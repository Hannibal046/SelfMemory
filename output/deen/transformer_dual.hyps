( d ) Fourth , one can resort to the &amp; quot ; Contractor &amp; apos ; s Basis &amp; quot ; method . This method arrives at the rental value by estimating the decapitalised &amp; # 91 ; 23 &amp; # 93 ; costs of constructing a similar hereditament adjusted for age and obsolescence , by looking at the cost of the capital which would be raised to finance the build-out , i.e. the interest which one would need to pay for a loan or the

In 2003 , a provision of a total balance of an old bank account in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( formerly Zaire ) was established following the prison that it could become impossible to recover the assets amounting to EUR 2,74 million since the Commission had no representation in that country and no movement had taken place in the account for several years .

( 6 ) The nature and objectives of this measure make it appropriate to apply Article 13 of Regulation ( EC ) No 1784 / 2003 and the Regulations adopted pursuant to that Article , in particular Commission Regulation ( EC ) No 1501 / 95 of 29 June 1995 laying down certain detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation ( EEC ) No 1766 / 92 on the granting of export refunds on cereals and the measures to be taken in the event of disturbance on the market for cereals &amp; # 91 ; 2 &amp; # 93 ; .
4.6 The efforts made to go abreast of natural resources are reflected by technological innovations , which are associated with a growing crop and a cost reduction . For example , the paper industry has significantly decreased its use in recent years . Some 15 years ago , hundreds of cubic metres water have been needed to produce one tonne of paper , and the pollution generated today has been reduced by up to 90 % , but has has a benefit from economic benefits .
( 14 ) In Article 24 ( 2 ) and in the Annex to Regulation ( EC ) No 1257 / 1999 , the maximum amounts per year eligible for Community support for agri-environmental support are fixed .

3.1.1 The annex to the White Paper contains an analysis of the compatibility of liner conference conferences with the four cumulative conditions of Article 81 ( 3 ) of the EC Treaty . However , since , in recent years , capacity regulation is only justified under EU law , it is not possible to indicate whether the four cumulative conditions of Article 81 ( 3 ) of the EC Treaty can be fulfilled and that the liner conference no longer have the power to fix prices , whether the four cumulative conditions of Article 81 ( 3 ) of the EC Treaty are fulfilled .
Member States of the branch shall provide that , where an insurance undertaking authorized in another Member State carries on its activities through a branch , the competent authorities of the home Member State may , after having first informed the competent authorities of the Member State of the branch , carry out themselves or through the intermediary of persons they appoint for that purpose on-the-spot verification of the information referred to in the said Article .

( 33 ) On this basis , it was found that the Community industry had overall domestic sales of the product under consideration which were made in representative quantities during the IP . For the other exporting producer the overall domestic sales of the product concerned during the Eurostat data range were not made in representative quantities . It should be noted that the difference between the Chinese exporting producer and the facts available , as already explained above , does not rule out the possibility of exporting from China ’ s prices to the Community .
( 7 ) Spirit drinks are considered less sensitive than other goods to the price of the cereals used in their manufacture . However , Protocol 19 of the Act of Accession of Denmark , Ireland and the United Kingdom provides that the necessary measures must be decided to facilitate the use of Community cereals in the manufacture of spirit drinks obtained from cereals .

It is evident that the collection of excise duties on alcoholic beverages lies within the 26 Indian States . In principle , excise duties are only levied on products which have undergone a manufacturing process in India . Consequently , imports of bottled wines and spirits will in principle not be subject to excise duty . Only domestic production and bulk goods in India , which are filled , are taxed at different rates , whichever is the higher of the 26 Indian States , is the tax .
The Commission supports the objective of promoting a high level of environmental protection by taking into account the diversity of situations in the different regions . Since the Alpine region is an ecologically high-risk area , the EC must pay greater attention to this region and its problems by means of an appropriate approach . The priority areas of the Sixth Environment Action Programme &amp; # 91 ; 1 &amp; # 93 ; – climate change , nature , biodiversity , health and quality of life , as well as natural resources and waste can be encouraged and strengthened in mountain regions by international agreements .

The productivity of the English and French language units is regularly under average ( between 5 % and 20 % depending on year ) , when the productivity differences in the other EU-15 languages are limited to 10 % .

( 78 ) Given the analysis of Algeria &amp; apos ; s spare capacity , price comparison between the Community and Algeria and the fact that imports originating in Algeria continue to take place at dumped prices , the continuation of Algerian dumping is likely in the future .

3.1.5 One argument put forward by the extended reference period is the greater flexibility for businesses in dealing with working time . This flexibility , thanks to collective agreements , already exists in many countries ; the problem of flexibility concerns those countries where collective agreements traditionally play a minor role .

Hence , research resources in the fields of climate , energy , transport and production and consumption need to be substantially increased in the forthcoming Seventh Framework Programme . International cooperation on the development of break-out technologies must be developed through
