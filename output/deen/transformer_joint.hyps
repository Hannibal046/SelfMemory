( d ) Fourth , one can resort to the &amp; quot ; Contractor &amp; apos ; s Basis &amp; quot ; method . This method arrives at the rental value by estimating the decapitalised &amp; # 91 ; 23 &amp; # 93 ; costs of constructing a similar hereditament adjusted for age and obsolescence , by looking at the cost of the capital which would need to be raised to finance the build-out , i.e. the interest that one would need to pay for a loan
2.9.The Court notes that the Commission has focused on the setting-up of an integrated internal control framework ( see paragraph 2.3 ) . It also welcomes the fact that the Commission has updated the multiannual objectives of its 2004 action plan &amp; # 91 ; 6 &amp; # 93 ; and has now addressed the main crosscutting issues in 2005 , that most of the weaknesses can only be corrected in the medium term &amp; # 91 ; 7 &amp; # 93 ; . &amp; # 124 ; &amp; # 124 ;

The Commission appreciates the simplicity of the new splitting of daily rest , but considers the regulation of the reduced daily rest to be a step with regard to road safety and working conditions . It accepts the continuation of a very long compensation period for weekly rest , and considers that a weekly minimum number of hours of rest is required within a two-week period , as well as the option of checking records up to 28 days for roadside checks , is a step forward .
( 7 ) In order to reduce the risk for passengers , Community air carriers failing to comply with the conditions for maintaining an operating licence should no longer be allowed to operate . In such cases , the competent licensing authority should revoke or suspend the operating licence . In cases where the competent licensing authority fails to do so , the Commission should be entitled to revoke or suspend the operating licence in order to ensure uniform application of Community legislation .

( 69 ) Germany argues that the difference between the actual losses in the 1995 report and the Arthur Andersen report submitted on 25 July 1997 by the expert audit firm was , at the latest , known on 31 December 1996 , that the risk assessments were not fully detailed and that , as a result of the 1996 survey , the situation had changed as a result offa &amp; apos ; s time . Therefore , the actual losses less significant at 31 December 1995 could be forecast .

In 2003 , a provision was made for prudentialisation of the total balance of an old bank account in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( former Zaire ) in view of the fact that recovery of the credit could be EUR 2.74 million as the Commission did not have any representation in that country and no movement has occurred in the account for a number of years . After the Commission received a confirmation of the bankkontensaldo in 2004 ( after completion of the action in that country ) , this provision has been recovered .
( 2 ) Regulation ( EC ) No 693 / 2003 ( 3 ) establishes a Facilitated Transit Document ( FTD ) and a Facilitated Transit Document ( FRTD ) for the specific transit of third-country nationals necessarily bordering the territory of one or more Member States by travellers by travellers between two geographical areas of their country or territories .

Article 6 ( 4 ) provides that the ECB may adopt regulations laying down the conditions under which the right to verify or indeed collect statistical information may be exercised .
( 6 ) The nature and objectives of this measure make it appropriate to apply Article 13 of Regulation ( EC ) No 1784 / 2003 and the Regulations adopted pursuant to this Article , and in particular Commission Regulation ( EC ) No 1501 / 95 of 29 June 1995 laying down certain detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation ( EEC ) No 1766 / 92 on the granting of export refunds on cereals and the measures to be taken in the event of disturbance on the market for cereals &amp; # 91 ; 2 &amp; # 93 ; .
4.6 The attempt to deal with natural resources is evidenced by technical innovations that are linked to sound management and cost-reduction . For example , in recent years the paper industry has made a significant reduction in water consumption . Some fifteen hundred cubic metres of water needed to produce one tonne of paper , is an average of 48 m3 , with the that the amount of pollutants caused could be reduced by a maximum of 90 % for economic gain .
( 14 ) Article 24 ( 2 ) and the Annex to Regulation ( EC ) No 1257 / 1999 set the maximum amounts per year eligible for Community support for agri-environmental measures . In order to take account of the specific environmental situation of some very sensitive pasture areas in the Azores and of the protection of the landscape and traditional characteristics of the agricultural areas , in particular Madeira &amp; apos ; s Terran cultivation , provision should be made for those amounts to be increased until double the measures .
Slovenia contributed EUR 65000 to OSCE destruction projects for small arms and light weapons in Tajikistan ( SIT 9.7 million to 40000 ) and in Ukraine ( SIT 6.1 to SIT 25000 ) . The Slovenian Diplomat Jernej Cimperšek , Unit to the Permanent Representation to the OSCE in Vienna , was appointed to the Coordinator of the Forums for Security ( FSC ) .

3.1.1 The annex to the White Paper includes an analysis of the compatibility of liner conferences with the four cumulative conditions of Article 81 ( 3 ) of the EC Treaty . However , as capacity regulation under EU law is justified in recent years only on condition that it does not create artificial demand limits in connection with a &amp; quot ; cargo &amp; quot ; increase , and the liner conferences have hardly determine that the four cumulative conditions can be fulfilled or Article 81 ( 3 ) of the EC Treaty .
Member States of the branch shall provide that , where an assurance undertaking authorized in another Member State carries on its activities through a branch , the competent authorities of the home Member State may , after having first informed the competent authorities of the Member State of the branch , carry out themselves or through the intermediary of persons they appoint for that purpose on-the-spot verification of the information required for the supervision of the undertaking . The authorities of the Member State of the branch may participate in this verification . &amp; apos ;
&amp; apos ; Before sealed , a sample of the oil may be used by the successful tenderer . This sample shall be put into two labelled bottles , which shall be sealed in the presence of both the storer and the prospective purchaser or his duly authorized agent .

( 5 ) Insurance undertakings should draw up their annual accounts and consolidated accounts in accordance with Council Directive 91 / 674 / EEC of 19 December 1991 on the annual accounts and consolidated accounts of insurance undertakings ( 7 ) . The amendments to Directives 78 / 660 / EEC and 83 / 349 / EEC are without prejudice to Directive 91 / 674 / EEC , but the Commission may , after consulting the relevant Advisory Committee , submit proposals to amend that Directive .
( 99 ) If measures are not imposed it is likely that the price pressure from the dumped imports will increase , the financial situation of the Community industry will continue to deteriorate further and more Community producers will be forced to cease production , with adverse consequences for the broader sector already suffering from imports made at dumped prices ( see below ) . In imposing measures , both as regards prices and profitability could lead to a commercially sustainable level , and ensure the economic survival of the European wine-sector .
4 . The containers referred to in paragraph 3 shall be opened in the packing centre immediately before grading starts . All eggs from a single container shall be graded and packed without interruption . The laying date shall be stamped during or immediately after grading on those eggs intended for such marking . In the case of packing centres coming from their own production units situated on the same holding , eggs shall be graded and / or packed at other packing centres .

( 33 ) The Community industry provided information on its joint ventures in China . On this basis , it was found that this company did not produce the product concerned falling within the CN code in question but did not display other screen parts . A deviation of Eurostat figures from the Chinese exporting producer ’ s information shows that on the basis of the facts available , as outlined above , it cannot be excluded that exports from China to the Community were due to other image factors that of this proceeding .
( 7 ) Spirit drinks are considered less sensitive than other goods to the price of the cereals used in their manufacture . However , Protocol 19 of the Act of Accession of Denmark , Ireland and the United Kingdom provides that the necessary measures must be decided to facilitate the use of Community cereals in the manufacture of spirit drinks obtained from cereals . rates of refund for cereals exported in the form of spirit drinks should therefore be adapted .
( 1 ) According to Article 4 ( 4 ) of Council Regulation ( EC ) No 2007 / 2000 , imports of sugar products under headings 1701 and 1702 of the Combined Nomenclature originating in Albania , Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia , Montenegro and Kosovo &amp; # 91 ; 2 &amp; # 93 ; shall be subject to duty-free annual tariff quotas .

( 2 ) New types of packaging for foodstuffs have been developed in recent years . Where the intervention agencies prescribe certain new packaging , they should require that this packaging complies with Regulation ( EC ) No 1935 / 2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 October 2004 on materials and articles intended to come into contact with food and repealing Directives 80 / 590 / EEC and 89 / 109 / EEC &amp; # 91 ; 3 &amp; # 93 ; .
According to India , the responsibility for the levying of excise duties on alcoholic beverages lies with the 26 Indian States . As a general rule , excise duties are collected exclusively on products which have been subjected to a manufacturing process in India . Consequently , imports of packaged wines and spirits are not subject to excise duty . Only domestic production and loose goods packaged in India are taxed at a very different rate , depending on the 26 Indian States .
The Commission supports the objective of promoting a high level of environmental protection by taking into account the diversity of conditions in different regions . Given that the Alpine region is an environmentally sensitive area , the EC needs to pay greater attention to this region and address its problems by taking appropriate action . The priority areas of the Sixth Environmental Action Programme &amp; # 91 ; 1 &amp; # 93 ; – climate change , nature and biodiversity , quality of life , and natural resources and waste can be promoted and strengthened by international agreements .
The European Union has made it possible to make further progress only through an open and constructive direct dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina . The “ direct dialogue ” was launched in October 2003 , with the first meetings of the Working Groups on Energy and with missing persons in early March 2004 . However , the violent developments of this positive development , which started in March 2004 . These meetings will now be reinstated , and the EU will chair the energy working group .

Whereas the Commission &amp; apos ; s proposal for the guidelines referred to in Article 129c ( 1 ) of the Treaty will be examined by the European Parliament and the Council ; whereas , if the decisions adopting these guidelines on the date of entry into force of this Regulation have not yet entered into force , provision should be made for a Community contribution to individual priority projects within the limit of the appropriations available for the financial year 1995 ;
5 . Without prejudice to paragraph 4 , Member States may , in the cases provided for in paragraph 3 ( b ) , grant formal authorisation exempting the exporter concerned from furnishing the transport documents relating to all exports covered by an authorization , provided that the exporter concerned is required to submit transport documents for at least 10 % of such export declarations or , for at least one year , the number of such documents , on the basis of the criteria laid down in Regulation ( EC ) No 3122 / 94 .
8 .

In the air sector , passenger rights have been strengthened and increased security has been abolished to Europeans at work and travel in Europe . National authorities need to intensify the complaint processing . Passengers using shipping and rail travel will enjoy similar rights under future legislation . Bus passengers will benefit from higher quality of service . Service quality is an important competitive factor for all modes of transport . Increasing efforts should be made to ensure better mobility of passengers with limited mobility .

4.7.3.3 The EESC believes that reform of the systems should promote the self-employed management of people with disabilities . Crouting and developing alternative welfare services should be included as a specific objective in the new long-term care strategy as well as in the new social protection strategy . Other alternatives should include actions such as personal help , technical assistance , support , information , coaching , self-defined care and care , etc .
( 4 ) Respect of the international commitments entered into by the Community implies that refunds granted on exports of agricultural products incorporated in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may not exceed the refunds that would be payable on those products when exported in the unaltered state . Provision should therefore be made for such situations without preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts from establishing a refund rate for the early fixing of refunds .

All relevant information and requests for consultation , the sending of a questionnaire or the issuing of certificates demonstrating that the import is not circumventing must be made in writing ( not in electronic format , unless otherwise specified ) , and must indicate the name , address , e-mail address , telephone and / or fax numbers of the interested party to the following address : European Commission , Directorate-General for Trade , Directorate-General B and C.
48 . Under these conditions , without prejudice to OLAF &amp; apos ; s intervention in the context of the principle of subsidiarity in other operational areas , there would be a new priority for investigations within the institutions and institutions , as well as for expenditure directly managed by the Commission ; and stresses that the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe provides , in Article III-274 , that a European Public Prosecutor &amp; apos ; s financial interests can be used to fight criminal offences against the EU financial interests from Eurojust ;
After first contributions from the United States and other countries , the European Community also wanted to support the initiative since its objectives are met by the Fund &amp; apos ; s objectives . As a result , it has been contributing to the IFI since 1989 . The Community &amp; apos ; s financial contributions now represent about 48 % of the annual contribution to the Fund and 40 % of cumulative contributions to that date . The Commission has been represented by an observer since early 1989 at all meetings of the IFI Management Board .
( 1 ) The United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances , adopted in Vienna on 19 December 1988 , hereinafter referred to as the &amp; quot ; United Nations Convention &amp; quot ; , forms part of the global efforts to combat illicit drugs . Within its competences , the Community participated in the negotiations and the Convention on behalf of the Community by Council Decision 90 / 611 / EEC &amp; # 91 ; 1 &amp; # 93 ; .
( 19 ) Rural development programmes are to be financed by means of a financial contribution from the Community &amp; apos ; s budget , subject to the commitment of funds in annual instalments . In order to enable the Member States to implement the programmes , they must be made available in the Member States . Provision should therefore be made for an advance system which will ensure a regular flow of expenditure and for appropriate payments to beneficiaries , while at the same time laying down the limits for the advance scheme .

83 . The productivity of English and French language certificates is regularly under average with the Parliament ( 5 % to 20 % per year ) , whereas differences in productivity in the other EU-15 languages are limited to 10 % . The reason for this is the average number of translators through the French unit , which are accompanied by an average divercing of translations . As regards English translation , there is a lower need for translation services , as the majority of internal documents in English are accompanied by outsourcing rates and overcapacity .
( 9 ) The payment requirements of the Member States based on the new agricultural regulations are largely not included in the beginning of the financial year . Therefore , the ceiling for ex ante commitments in the EAGF ( as from 15 November of year n-1 ) on the financing of administrative expenditure attributable to the budget of the year n should be discontinued . The provision on the ceiling for prior commitment to administrative authority should be amended so as to refer to the allocations decided by the budgetary authority .
Nowledge arising from work carried out under direct actions may be made available to one or more interested legal entities , in particular those established in a Member State or associated State , provided that the legal entities undertake to use the knowledge or ensure that it is used . The provision of knowledge shall be subject to appropriate conditions , in particular payment of an indemnity , to be determined and published by the Commission .
The definition of specific requirements for the strength of the seats for motor vehicles of category M2 should be further explored in the light of experience and knowledge of accident research . It is also necessary to further examine the behaviour of the seats when coupled with a heavy occupant and a non-scheduled occupant on the rear . In the next two years , a research programme should be implemented for the development of a new static test for an equivalent level of safety .
1 . Where products or certain aspects of products have not yet been legally harmonized at Community level , the following provisions shall apply : ( a ) where a Member State wishes to accept that compliance with national technical regulations and standards is determined on the basis of test results , certificates or marks issued by the competent authorities of a third country , it shall inform the Commission and the other Member States thereof , stating the reasons ;
77 . The Commission considered that the decision establishing the scale had to be considered as a special legal act in its own form and is entirely part of the Board acting as an association of undertakings . It also concluded that the Board had the intention of the Board to coordinate the behaviour of its members on the market by means of decisions to impose and amend the scale of fees . The Commission also found that the scale was applied at least to some extent .
common position of the Council on the adoption of a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation ( EEC ) No 1408 / 71 on the application of social security schemes to employed persons , to self-employed persons and to members of their families moving within the Community and Council Regulation ( EEC ) No 574 / 72 laying down the procedure for implementing Regulation ( EEC ) No 1408 / 71 ( various amendments )
( 2 ) Article 22 ( 2 ) of Regulation ( EC ) No 1260 / 1999 extends the scope of the measures referred to in paragraph 1 ( a ) , by decision on the contribution of the Funds , to measures that may be financed under Regulations ( EC ) No 1783 / 1999 , ( EC ) No 1257 / 1999 and ( EC ) No 1263 / 1999 in order to include all measures necessary for the implementation of innovative measures .

The EESC has already pointed out that the Commission &amp; apos ; s opinion on Consumer Protection Strategy 2002-2006 &amp; # 91 ; 11 &amp; # 93 ; has already drawn up a number of shortcomings . The EESC has recently adopted an own-initiative opinion , which has been addressed

1 . The Commission shall represent the Community in the Joint Committee provided for in Article 14 of the Agreement , and in the Joint Sectoral Committees established by the Sectoral Annexes , assisted by the special Committee designated by the Council . The Commission shall proceed , after consultation with this special Committee , to the appointments , notifications , exchanges of information and requests for information for information for information specified in Articles 10 ( b ) , 12 , 13 and 14 ( 2 ) of the Agreement and the corresponding provisions of the Sectoral Annexes .

( 78 ) Given the analysis of the spare capacity of Algeria , the price comparisons between the Community and Algeria , and the fact that imports originating in Algeria are still at dumped prices , there is a likelihood of continuation of Algerian dumping . Given the fact that the Community was the only export market for Algeria during the RIP , it is very likely that Algerian exporters would try to stop the removal of any production which was largely on this market .
3.2 The Committee welcomes the Framework Programme as an important step towards creating synergies in the promotion of competitiveness and innovation between enterprises and sustainable development . The proposed measures and instruments can make an important contribution to strengthening social cohesion , promoting sustainable economic development and achieving the Lisbon Strategy &amp; apos ; s growth and employment objectives . The Commission also emphasises , in the proposed Action Plan to pursue the Lisbon Strategy at Community level ( COM ( 2005 ) 330 ) , the Framework Programme as an important element of Community policy .
( 1 ) For a number of years , the presence of a variant of the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease ( CJD ) has been recognised for the first time in 1986 and in subsequent years it has been found that the disease is present in other animal species . A new variant of the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease ( CJD ) has been described for the first time in 1996 and in subsequent years . The evidence of the similarity of the BSE agent with the new variant of the Creutzfeldt-Jakob
( 14 ) Certification of training offers should be considered as one of the key pillars responsible for safety which contribute to the quality of training . Training should be considered as a service of a similar nature to air navigation services which are also covered by a certification procedure . This Directive should make it possible to pinpoint training according to the type of training , by coupling of training services or by coupling of training services , without losing the specific characteristics of training .
( 17 ) Contamination of food with lead is of public health concern . Lead accumulates to some extent in kidney and liver tissue , muscle tissues contain very low residual amounts of lead and carry-over into animal health concern . Therefore foods of animal origin are not a major source of human exposure to cadmium , muscle tissues contain very residual amounts of lead and carry-over into animal health concern . Therefore , for all lifetime , it can lead to a major source of human exposure to human exposure to cadmium .
3.1.5 One of the reasons behind the extended reference period is that of greater flexibility for companies in terms of working time . Such flexibility is due to collective agreements already exists in many countries ; the problem of the flexibility extends to countries where collective agreements are traditionally insignificant . It would also be important to strengthen the collective agreement in periods of work , including in countries and sectors where it is not particularly strong .
( 4 ) The management measures for raw cane sugar produced in the French overseas departments benefiting from the additional aid should be the same as those laid down in Commission Regulation ( EC ) No 1554 / 2001 of 30 July 2001 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation ( EC ) No 1260 / 2001 as regards marketing sugar produced in the French overseas departments and equalising the price conditions with preferential raw sugar ( 4 ) .
( 303 ) The Commission also examined the injurious effects of the restructuring costs that the Community producers have incurred in recent years . In this context , it should be noted that restructuring operations are likely to generate a short-term cost in terms of inventions , removal costs , etc . The medium-term gains in terms of efficiency gains . In view of the ongoing process of rationalisation , the costs currently incurred , even if they were found to be very low , will have an impact on the cost structure .

In the area of public health , implementation of modernisation programmes for food processing plants has continued . The number of holdings that do not meet the requirements and have not established a modernisation plan has been significantly reduced . As good progress is being made , the pace of modernisation in progress should be maintained . Preparations to improve the collection and treatment of non-compliant raw milk should be accelerated . The legislation on direct sales still remains to be completed .
( 393 ) However , it should be noted that winter terminal prices have increased significantly since the period when BE was in difficulty . Various pricing agencies have reported figures of more than GBP 20 / MWh winter baselo price for the next few years , with increases in GBP 27 / MWh &amp; # 91 ; 60 &amp; # 93 ; . This is apparently permanent and sustainable operators ’ rates for the next few years . The cost rates for new operators vary from GBP 20 / MWh to GBP 25 / MWh &amp; # 91 ; 61
1.2 The drawing-up of this new proposal for a Directive is crucially due to : ( 1 ) the inclusion of a specific reference to the financing of terrorism , despite the fact that the Member States considered it to be a serious crime in the previous Directive , and to ( 2 ) the inclusion of 40 revised recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force ( FATF ) published in June 2003 &amp; # 91 ; 1 &amp; # 93 ; .
In support of its claims , the applicant also claims that the contested decision infringes Article 53 EC , Article 6 of Regulation ( EC ) No 1784 / 1999 , Articles 22 and 24 of Regulation No 1260 / 1999 , the rules set out in COM ( 2000 ) 894 final &amp; # 91 ; 2 &amp; # 93 ; and the rules adopted by the Commission in connection with its call for proposals &amp; # 91 ; 3 &amp; # 93 ; .

2 . Each Member State shall offer two or more lawyers belonging to the same group or coming from the same Member State of origin and practising under its initial professional title in its territory the possibility of gaining access to a form of joint practises . If the host Member State makes available different forms of joint practises , such lawyers shall also be accessible to the lawyers referred to in the first sentence . The manner in which such lawyers practise jointly in the host Member State shall be governed by the laws , regulations and administrative provisions of that State .
Whereas Council Regulation ( EEC ) No 2358 / 71 of 26 October 1971 on the common organization of the market in seeds ( 5 ) , as last amended by Regulation ( EEC ) No 1346 / 78 ( 6 ) , and Council Regulation ( EEC ) No 1035 / 72 of 18 May 1972 on the common organization of the market in fruit and vegetables ( 7 ) , as last amended by Regulation ( EEC ) No 1766 / 78 ( 8 ) , do not lay down such provisions and should be supplemented accordingly ;
( 1 ) Article 3 of Commission Regulation ( EEC ) No 411 / 88 of 12 February 1988 on the method and the rate of interest to be used for calculating the costs of financing intervention measures comprising buying-in , storage and disposal &amp; # 91 ; 2 &amp; # 93 ; provides that the uniform rate of interest to be used for calculating the costs of financing intervention is the same as the Euribor rate , which is three months and 12 months , weighted as one third .
5.2.1 The lack of specific legal instruments for the protection of public health has led to the use of indirect or fragmented social security rules in certain EU Member States . Health and economic challenges are perpetrators , in particular : although they are legitimate to assess health costs and attempt to ensure the most rational use of health limited-related resources , it is also dangerous to try to envisage problems .
The applicants claim that the European Parliament should : - annul decisions Nos 102494 , 102494 and 102496 of 8 February 2005 whereby the appointing authority of the Communities of the European Parliament refused to reimburse to the applicants the excess premium resulting from the difference between the rights acquired during the years when they were affiliated to the Italian scheme and the number of annuities transferred to the Italian scheme following a new calculation of their pension rights ;
- introducing appropriate standards of registration , transparency and accounting which provide a visible status to non-profit organisations and help them to raise public confidence and respect them as well as the credibility of their work . - granting tax rules , public subsidies and the right to non-profit collections to non-profit organisations which meet registration requirements and comply with the transparency and accounting rules set out above , for example , a possibility of ensuring compliance with the above mentioned rules ,
The EU and the Pacific ACP countries &amp; # 91 ; 1 &amp; # 93 ; have been on the basis of multi-annual cooperation in the EU-ACP partnership . This long-standing relationship is based on the development of a common history , shared values and economic and trade cooperation . Good developments on both sides justify the renewal of this partnership and the definition of a comprehensive strategy towards the Pacific ACP countries . There are convinced reasons for this first strategy to be proposed by the EU towards the Pacific region .
The main objective of the Community ’ s strategic guidelines for cohesion policy is to provide guidance to Member States in the preparation of the national strategic reference framework , in order to ensure that the programmes co-financed by the Funds are consistent with the priorities identified at Community level , in particular with a view to implementing the Lisbon Growth and Jobs Agenda . In the light of the above and in line with the renewed Lisbon strategy for growth and jobs , programmes co-financed through cohesion policy programmes should seek to target resources on the following three priorities :

( 1 ) The municipal council of Haaksbergen , a site situated in the nearest province of Overijssel in the boundary of the German territory , was earlier than at the beginning of the 1990s with the intention to meet the low level of urban centres . Six construction companies were expected at the end of the 1990s , together with their land and enclosed , as they did not seem equip their project to the detriment of 58 Appartements and 11 retail outlets .
In accordance with Article 2 of Council Regulation ( EC ) No 851 / 2005 , amending Regulation ( EC ) No 539 / 2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement as regards the reciprocity mechanism , Latvia would like to notify the Council and the Commission that the Federative Republic of Brazil continues to apply the reciprocity mechanism vis-à-vis the citizens of the Republic of Latvia .
2 . If a Member State finds that vehicles , systems , separate technical units or components do not conform to the approved type , it may request the Member State which has granted type-approval to verify discrepancies observed . The Member State which has granted type-approval shall carry out the necessary checks within six months of receipt of the request . If non-conformity is found , the competent authorities of the Member State which granted type-approval shall take the measures provided for in paragraph 1 .

( 12 ) In order to achieve the objectives of this Directive , the obligations relating to the sulphur content of marine fuels need to be enforced . Effective sampling and dissuasive sanctions throughout the Community are necessary to ensure the credible implementation of the Directive . Member States should take enforcement action in respect of vessels flying their flag and of vessels of all flags throughout their ports . Member States should also cooperate closely to take additional enforcement action in respect of other vessels in accordance with international maritime law .
82 . Points out that the reform has a particular focus on decentralisation of financial controls ; considers that this in turn requires the most appropriate and simpler modalities for central monitoring the management of the supervisory systems applied in each department ; considers that , finally , this central monitoring of management should be reflected in an official report on the quality of the departments &amp; apos ; internal control systems , which should be published under the summary report ;
3 . The first processor who received the raw material shall inform the competent authority of the Member State of the nature and quantity of the raw material obtained , the name and address of the contractor who delivered the raw material , the place of delivery and the serial number of the contract in question , to enable payment to be made within the time limit laid down in Article 28 of Regulation ( EC ) No 1782 / 2003 .
4.14 Unknown , at both European and national level , is , on the other hand , still the budgetary effectiveness of these policies , which is understood as applying gender mainstreaming to budgetary procedures . When a gender perspective at all levels of the process for households , it is believed that administrative decisions in this respect are not neutral but have different implications for men and women . In this context , the gender-budgeting instrument is also a tool of assessing the impact of various policies , fiscal and gender policies .
( 4 ) In the context of the implementation of Article 1 of Council Directive 89 / 130 / EEC , Euratom of 13 February 1989 on the harmonisation of the compilation of gross national product at market prices &amp; # 91 ; 4 &amp; # 93 ; , the economic territory of Member States is defined by Commission Decision 91 / 450 / EEC , Euratom &amp; # 91 ; 5 &amp; # 93 ; . Such a definition should also be laid down for GNI .
The widespread technologies in the second half of this century need to be developed . Unfortunately , the members of the IEA since the early 1980s have halved their energy research and technology development funding . This trend needs to be reversed if the EU aims to improve its competitiveness in these markets . Research in climate , energy , transport and production and consumption areas should therefore be increased substantially by public-private partnerships .
( 1 ) On 23 May 2005 , the Council strongly condemned the excessive , disproportionate and indiscriminate use of force by the Uzbek security forces in Andijan , Eastern Uzbekistan , earlier that month . The Council called upon the Uzbek authorities to respond adequately to the United Nations &amp; apos ; call for an independent international inquiry and on , 13 June 2005 , these authorities to reconsider their position by the end of June 2005 .
( 4 ) The precise examination of the flavouring substances notified by the Member States and listed in Decision 1999 / 217 / EC has discovered a number of non-compliant chemical , names , synonyms and systematic designations , and in a number of cases the same substances have been included in the list under different chemical designations . Those differences should be rectified in relation to those which could not be resolved at this stage , at least the possibility of failing to comply with the information .

A significant knowledge of the public consultation conducted by the Commission in 2004 on the Green Paper on equality and non-discrimination in an enlarged European Union &amp; # 91 ; 8 &amp; # 93 ; has demonstrated the importance of awareness of the right to protection against discrimination . There is little point in law in attributing rights to citizens and citizens when they do not know that they do so . Article 10 of the Directive states that there is a need for national legislation adopted under the Directive to be given to all persons .
4 . The purpose of this proposal is to codify Council Regulation ( EEC ) No 4060 / 89 of 21 December 1989 on the abolition of border checks at Member States in the field of road and inland waterway transport &amp; # 91 ; 3 &amp; # 93 ; . The new Regulation replaces the various acts subject to codification &amp; # 91 ; 4 &amp; # 93 ; . It retains the substantive content of the legislative instruments , with only such amendments as are fully required by codification itself .
3 . The third plea alleges infringement of Article 88 EC and of Article 19 of Regulation ( EC ) No 659 / 1999 . The appropriate measures contained in the Commission &amp; apos ; s decision of 3 December 1997 on the provision of maritime transport services adopted by the Trasmediterránea and the Kingdom of Spain 1978 contest the abolition of the aid dividing line contained in that Treaty and aimed at extending it to the routes between the Canary Islands .
( 6 ) Water is included , as other foodstuffs are also , directly or indirectly , and therefore contributes to the consumer &amp; apos ; s overall exposure to added substances , including chemical and microbiological contaminants . However , since the quality of water intended for human consumption is already being monitored under Council Directives 80 / 778 / EEC ( 5 ) and 98 / 83 / EC ( 6 ) , it is sufficient to take water from the point of compliance as defined in Article 6 of Directive 98 / 83 / EC .
( 7 ) In order to ensure better implementation of the new programming period for agri-environmental and animal welfare , Member States should have the possibility to authorise the transformation of a commitment to agri-environment or animal welfare under Regulation ( EC ) No 1257 / 1999 into a new commitment for a period of between five and seven years as a general rule under Regulation ( EC ) No 1698 / 2005 provided that the new commitment is beneficial for the environment or animal welfare .
