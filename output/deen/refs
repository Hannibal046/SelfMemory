A State or entity which has deposited before the date of adoption of this Agreement an instrument of ratification or formal confirmation of or accession to the Convention and which has signed this Agreement in accordance with Article 4 ( 3 ) ( c ) shall be considered to have established its consent to be bound by this Agreement 12 months after the date of its adoption , unless that State or entity notifies the depository in writing before that date that it is not availing itself of the simplified procedure set out in this article .
( d ) Fourth , one can resort to the &amp; quot ; Contractor &amp; apos ; s Basis &amp; quot ; method . This method arrives at the rental value by estimating the decapitalised &amp; # 91 ; 23 &amp; # 93 ; costs of constructing a similar hereditament adjusted for age and obsolescence , by looking at the cost of the capital which would need to be raised to finance the build-out , i.e. the interest that one would need to pay for a loan or the foregone interest if one &amp; apos ; s own capital is used &amp; # 91 ; 24 &amp; # 93 ; .
2.9.The Court notes the emphasis that the Commission has placed on establishing an integrated internal control framework ( see paragraph 2.3 ) . Furthermore , it appreciates that the Commission updated the multi-annual objectives of its 2004 action plan &amp; # 91 ; 6 &amp; # 93 ; , addressing the major cross-cutting issues identified in the financial year 2005 and recognising that most of the weaknesses identified can be eliminated only in the medium term &amp; # 91 ; 7 &amp; # 93 ; . &amp; # 124 ; &amp; # 124 ;

2 . If the deadlines have not been observed or if only part of the financial support allocated is justified by the progress with implementation of a contract , the Commission shall request the beneficiary to submit any explanations within a specified period . If the beneficiary does not provide a satisfactory answer , the Commission may cancel the remaining financial aid and demand prompt repayment of sums already paid . The Commission undertakes to carry out a thorough and speedy evaluation of such explanations .
1 . Any Community vessel present in the Convention area for the purpose of harvesting or conducting scientific research on marine living resources shall , when given the appropriate signal in the International Code of Signals by a vessel carrying a CCAMLR inspector , in accordance with Article 23 , stop or take other such actions as necessary to facilitate the safe and prompt transfer of the inspector to the vessel , except where the vessel is actively engaged in harvesting operations , in which case it shall do so as soon as practicable .
( 8 ) The compilation of the Monetary Union index of consumer prices ( MUICP ) and the European index of consumer prices ( EICP ) requires a harmonised concept for the temporal coverage of the HICPs . This should not , however , preclude the release of provisional HICPs or HICP flash estimates of the average price change based on a part of the price information observed in the month to which the current index refers .

( 11 ) Directive 98 / 97 / EC of the European Parliament and of the Council &amp; # 91 ; 5 &amp; # 93 ; , subsequently amended Directive 76 / 116 / EEC as regards the marketing in Austria , Finland and Sweden of fertilisers containing cadmium . Article 1 provides that , inter alia , Austria may prohibit the marketing on its territory of fertilisers containing cadmium at concentrations in excess of that which were fixed nationally at the date of accession and that this derogation applies for the period from 1 January 1999 until 31 December 2001 .
The aim of this common position is to contribute to the coherence of external Union activities in Africa , including appropriate policy responses . The Union recognises that democratisation is a process which can be assisted by appropriate support from the international community , including the Union , and that many African countries have successfully introduced reforms in recent years which have improved the ability of individuals to enjoy human rights and democratic processes .
The Commission welcomes the simplicity of the new split daily rest , but finds the arrangement for reduced daily rest a retrograde step in terms of road safety and working conditions . While it accepts the continuation of the lengthy compensation period for weekly rest , it considers the new provision on a minimum regular weekly rest requirement over a two week period an advance , with the option of checking up to 28 days records at the roadside an advantage for enforcement staff .
( 7 ) To reduce risks to passengers , Community air carriers failing to fulfil the requirements for maintaining a valid operating licence should not be allowed to continue operations . In these cases , the competent licensing authority should revoke or suspend the operating licence . In cases where the competent licensing authority fails to do so , the Commission should be allowed to revoke or suspend the operating licence in order to ensure the homogeneous application of Community legislation .
The Commission partially accepted amendment 44 , namely the replacement of the word ‘ arrange ’ by ‘ provide ’ as well as the addition of the word ‘ collection ’ and ‘ environmentally ’ . Article 13 of the common position partly incorporates this amendment by including the word ‘ collection ’ .
This Decision establishes the Community Programme for Employment and Social Solidarity , named PROGRESS , to financially support the implementation of the objectives of the European Union in the employment and social affairs area and thereby contribute to the achievement in the context of the Lisbon Strategy goals in these fields contribute to achieving the objectives of the Social Agenda ( 2006 – 2010 ) &amp; # 91 ; 18 &amp; # 93 ; .

( 69 ) Germany explained the difference between the actual losses in the 1995 report and the report submitted later by Arthur Andersen to Germany by letter of 25 July 1997 concerning the situation at 31 December 1996 . They are due to the fact that the risk estimations were not fully realised and that the situation proved to be different in 1996 due to the time factor . Some risks that were envisaged did not materialise . Therefore , the actual losses turned out to be less than those estimated at 31 December 1995 .

Perfluorooctane sulfonates ( PFOS ) are anions that are commercially available in the form of salts , derivatives and polymers . The major uses for PFOS-related substances were in providing grease , oil and water resistance to materials such as textiles , carpets , paper and in general coating . The substances used in these areas were largely PFOS-polymers for fabrics and PFOS-substances for paper treatment and coatings . Other smaller volume uses are in chromium plating , photography , photolithography , fire fighting foams and in hydraulic fluids for aviation .
( 3 ) The Commission examined the evidence submitted by the applicant and considered it sufficient to justify the initiation of a review in accordance with Article 11 ( 4 ) of the basic Regulation . After consultation of the Advisory Committee and after the Community industry concerned had been given the opportunity to comment , the Commission initiated , by Regulation ( EC ) No 1408 / 2004 , a review of Regulation ( EC ) No 2605 / 2000 with regard to the applicant and commenced its investigation .

In 2003 , following the prudence principle , a provision was created for the full balance of an old bank account in Congo ( former Zaire ) amounting to 2,74 million Euro , about which there were some doubt as to recoverability due to the fact that there was no Commission presence in the country and there had been no movements on the account for several years . However as the bank balance was confirmed to the Commission during 2004 ( on resumption of activities in the country ) , this provision has now been reversed .
( 2 ) Council Regulation ( EC ) No 693 / 2003 ( 3 ) establishes a Facilitated Transit Document ( FTD ) and Facilitated Rail Transit Document ( FRTD ) for the case of a specific transit by land of third country nationals who must necessarily cross the territory of one or several Member States in order to travel between two parts of their own country which are not geographically contiguous . Uniform formats for these documents should be established .
( 6 ) Article 3 of Regulation ( EC ) No 2533 / 98 requires the ECB to specify the actual reporting population within the limits of the reference reporting population and entitles it to fully or partly exempt specific classes of reporting agents from its statistical reporting requirements . Article 6 ( 4 ) provides that the ECB may adopt regulations specifying the conditions under which the right to verify or to carry out the compulsory collection of statistical information may be exercised .
( 6 ) The nature and objectives of the said measure make it appropriate to apply to it , mutatis mutandis , Article 13 of Regulation ( EC ) No 1784 / 2003 and the Regulations adopted for its implementation , in particular Commission Regulation ( EC ) No 1501 / 95 laying down certain detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation ( EEC ) No 1766 / 92 on the granting of export refunds on cereals and the measures to be taken in the event of disturbance on the market for cereals &amp; # 91 ; 2 &amp; # 93 ; .
4.6 The concern to save natural resources has led to technical innovations tending to favour thrifty management and reduce costs . For example , the paper industry has cut back on water consumption considerably in recent years : whereas production of one ton of paper required almost one hundred cubic metres of water fifteen years ago , on average only 48 cubic metres are needed now . In addition , discharge of pollutants has been reduced by almost 90 % . The benefits are both economic and environmental .
( 14 ) Article 24 ( 2 ) of Regulation ( EC ) No 1257 / 1999 and the Annex thereto determine the maximum amounts per year eligible for Community agri-environmental aid . To take into account the specific environmental situation of certain very sensitive pasture areas in the Azores and the preservation of the landscape and traditional features of agricultural land , in particular the areas of terrace cultivation in Madeira , provision should be made for the possibility , in the case of certain specific measures , of increasing those amounts up to twofold .
Slovenia contributed EUR 65000 EUR to OSCE SALW ammunition destruction projects in Tajikistan ( SIT 9.7 million — EUR 40000 ) and in Ukraine ( SIT 6.1 million — EUR 25000 ) . Slovene diplomat Mr Jernej Cimperšek , counsellor at the Permanent Mission to the OSCE in Vienna , was appointed as Forum for Security Cooperation ( FSC ) coordinator for conventional ammunition . Slovenia submitted the National Report on the implementation of the OSCE document on Small Arms and Light Weapons ( SALW ) .
1 . The Commission shall represent the Community in the Technical Commission provided for in Article VII of the Agreement , after having heard the views of the members of the European Community Energy Star Board established by Regulation ( EC ) No 2422 / 2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council . After consulting the European Community Energy Star Board , the Commission shall carry out the tasks referred to in Articles VI ( 5 ) , VII ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , and IX ( 4 ) , of the Agreement .
3.1.1 The Annex to the White Paper provides an analysis regarding the compatibility of liner conferences with the four cumulative criteria of Article 81 ( 3 ) EC . However , in recent years where capacity utilization under EU jurisprudence is allowed only on condition that it will not create an artificial peak season in connection with rate increases and conference power to fix prices has largely disappeared &amp; # 91 ; 13 &amp; # 93 ; one can argue whether the four cumulative criteria of Article 81 ( 3 ) can still be fulfilled .
The Member State of the branch shall provide that where an insurance undertaking authorized in another Member State carries on business through a branch the competent authorities of the home Member State may , after having informed the competent authorities of the Member State of the branch , carry out themselves or through the intermediary of persons they appoint for that purpose on-the-spot verification of the information necessary to ensure the financial supervision of the undertaking . The authorities of the Member State of the branch may participate in that verification &amp; apos ; .
% quot % Before sealing is carried out , the successful tenderer may request a sample of this oil . This sample shall be put into two labelled bottles , which shall be sealed in the presence of both the storer and the successful tenderer or his duly authorized agent . One bottle shall be given to the successful tenderer and the other to the storer so that , if necessary , a check may be made to ensure that the product from which a sample was taken under Article 6 and the product awarded correspond . % quot %
( 5 ) The annual and consolidated accounts of insurance undertakings are prepared in accordance with Council Directive 91 / 674 / EEC of 19 December 1991 on the annual accounts and consolidated accounts of insurance undertakings ( 7 ) . The amendments to Directives 78 / 660 / EEC and 83 / 349 / EEC do not concern the provisions of Directive 91 / 674 / EEC , but the Commission may bring forward similar proposals to amend that Directive after having consulted the relevant advisory committee .
( 99 ) If measures are not imposed it is likely that following the price pressure from the dumped imports , the financial situation of the Community industry will continue to deteriorate and more Community producers will be forced to cease production , with adverse consequences for the broader wine-making sector ( see below ) . If however measures are imposed , it can be expected that prices and profitability will reach a more sustainable level , and that the economic viability of the European industry will be ensured .
4 . Containers referred to in paragraph 3 shall be opened in the packing centre immediately before grading starts . All eggs from a single container shall be graded and packed without interruption . The laying date shall be stamped during or immediately after grading on those eggs intended for such marking . In the case of packing centres supplied from their own production units situated at the same site , eggs are to be stamped , and / or graded and packed on the day of laying or delivered to other packing centres .
Whereas it is accepted that binding tariff information issued by the customs authorities of Member States in respect of the classification of goods in the combined nomenclature and which do not conform to the rights established by this Regulation , can continue to be invoked , under the provisions in Article 12 ( 6 ) of Council Regulation ( EEC ) No 2913 / 92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code ( 3 ) , for a period of three months by the holder ;
( 4 ) Taking into account the conclusions of the scientific opinions referred to in recital 1 , and the lack of reliable data on T-2 and HT-2 toxins , together with the large year-to-year variation in occurrence of these mycotoxins , it is appropriate to collect more data on these mycotoxins in the different feed materials and feedingstuffs , in addition to the data already available from the coordinated control programmes for 2002 &amp; # 91 ; 5 &amp; # 93 ; , 2004 &amp; # 91 ; 6 &amp; # 93 ; and 2005 &amp; # 91 ; 7 &amp; # 93 ; .
&amp; quot ; 1 . Par la présente , la Commission a l &amp; apos ; honneur d &amp; apos ; informer le Luxembourg qu &amp; apos ; elle a décidé d &amp; apos ; ouvrir la procédure prévue à l &amp; apos ; article 88 , paragraphe 2 , du Traité CE à l &amp; apos ; égard de la non-communication de leur acceptation des propositions de mesures appropriées conformément aux dispositions du chapitre IX des lignes directrices de la Communauté concernant les aides d &amp; apos ; État liées aux tests EST , aux animaux trouvés morts et aux déchets d &amp; apos ; abattoirs &amp; # 91 ; 1 &amp; # 93 ; .
( 33 ) The Community industry provided information on the joint venture it had in China . On this basis , it was found that this joint venture did not produce products covered by the CN code concerned but other display components . As regards the discrepancy between the Eurostat import statistics and the import figures declared by the Chinese exporting producer , it should be noted that , as mentioned above , the facts available do not exclude that CPTs other than the product concerned were exported from China to the Community .
( 7 ) Spirituous beverages are considered less sensitive to the price of the cereals used in their manufacture . However , Protocol 19 of the Act of Accession of the United Kingdom , Ireland and Denmark provides that the necessary measures must be decided to facilitate the use of Community cereals in the manufacture of spirituous beverages obtained from cereals . Accordingly , it is necessary to adapt the refund rate applying to cereals exported in the form of spirituous beverages .
( 1 ) Article 4 ( 4 ) of Council Regulation ( EC ) No 2007 / 2000 lays down that imports of sugar products under headings 1701 and 1702 of the Combined Nomenclature originating in Albania , Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia , Montenegro and Kosovo &amp; # 91 ; 2 &amp; # 93 ; , shall be subject to annual duty-free tariff quotas . Those quotas should be opened on a multiannual basis and detailed rules should be adopted for their application for 12-month periods starting on 1 July .
All interested parties , if their representations are to be taken into account during the investigation , must make themselves known by contacting the Commission , present their views and submit questionnaire replies or any other information within 40 days of the date of publication of this notice in the Official Journal of the European Union , unless otherwise specified . Attention is drawn to the fact that the exercise of most procedural rights set out in the basic Regulation depends on the party &amp; apos ; s making itself known within the aforementioned period .
( 1 ) The Council , by Regulation ( EC ) No 428 / 2005 &amp; # 91 ; 2 &amp; # 93 ; ( “ the definitive Regulation ” ) , imposed definitive anti-dumping duties on imports of polyester staple fibre ( “ PSF ” ) originating in the People ’ s Republic of China and Saudi Arabia , amended the definitive anti-dumping duties in force on such imports originating in South Korea and terminated the anti-dumping proceeding in respect to such imports originating in Taiwan .
2.3 is pleased to note that the White Paper acknowledges the role played by local and regional authorities , and , in particular , the role of the media in establishing dialogue with citizens and actively engaging local and regional communities in European issues ; recommends that the extensive network of media correspondents in Brussels be linked more effectively with local editorial offices , through appropriate measures ( workshops , inviting journalists to Brussels ) ; recalls that , in this sphere , local and regional authorities need appropriate operational resources to be effective ;

4 . In accordance with their respective responsibilities , the Commission and the Member States shall ensure coordination between assistance from the EFF and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development ( EAFRD ) , established by Council Regulation ( EC ) No 1290 / 2005 &amp; # 91 ; 9 &amp; # 93 ; , the European Regional Development Fund ( ERDF ) , the European Social Fund ( ESF ) , the Cohesion Fund and of other Community financial instruments .
( 2 ) New forms of packaging for foodstuffs have been developed during the last few years . Intervention agencies that require certain of these new forms of packaging should require that such packaging complies with Regulation ( EC ) No 1935 / 2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 October 2004 on materials and articles intended to come into contact with food and repealing Directives 80 / 590 / EEC and 89 / 109 / EEC &amp; # 91 ; 3 &amp; # 93 ; .
Under Indian law , jurisdiction to levy excise tax on alcoholic beverages lies with the 26 Indian State Governments . Excise tax is , in principle , levied only on products which have undergone a manufacturing process in India . Consequently , excise taxes are , in principle , not levied on imports of bottled wines and spirits . Only domestic production and bulk imports bottled in India are taxed ( at rates that vary significantly among the 26 Indian State Governments ) .
The Commission supports the objective of promoting a high level of environmental protection by taking into account the diversity of situations in the various regions . As the Alpine region is an ecologically highly sensitive area the EC must pay more attention to that region and must address its problems by an appropriate approach . Priority areas of the 6th Environment Action Programme &amp; # 91 ; 1 &amp; # 93 ; - climate change , nature and biodiversity , health and quality of life as well as natural resources and waste – can be promoted and strengthened in the mountain regions by international agreements .
The European Union has made it clear that open and constructive direct dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina is the only way forward . The ‘ direct dialogue ’ was launched in October 2003 , and the first meeting of the Working Groups on Energy and on Missing Persons took place in early March 2004 . However , the violent events that followed put a stop to this positive start . These meetings will now begin again , and the EU will provide a chairperson for the Working Group on Energy .

Whereas the guidelines referred to in Article 129c ( 1 ) of the Treaty , proposed by the Commission , are under consideration by the European Parliament and the Council ; whereas , should the decisions adopting these guidelines not have entered into force when this Regulation enters into force , provision should be made on a transitional basis for a possible Community contribution to specific priority projects within the limits of the appropriations available for the financial year 1995 and at the latest until 31 December 1995 ;
5 . Notwithstanding paragraph 4 , for the cases provided for in paragraph 3 ( b ) , Member States may exempt the exporter concerned from furnishing the transport documents for all exports covered by an authorisation , provided that the exporter concerned is required to furnish the transport documents in respect of a minimum of 10 % of such export declarations or one per annum , whichever is the greater , to be selected by Member States applying the criteria laid down in Regulation ( EC ) No 3122 / 94 .
8 . Notes , after exchanging information with the Centre , that the price per page set in 2003 budget , and invoiced by the Centre is EUR 77,50 , which includes all the costs of the Centre ( staff , buildings , IT , equipment , freelance translations , provisions for pensions and social conditions ) , as well as in-house linguistic quality-checking , formatting and updating , and all the necessary administrative costs of outsourcing ; calls on the Commission to evaluate the performance and added value of the different translation services together with the cost-benefit ratio ;
Passenger rights have been considerably strengthened for air travel , making Europeans more secure in enjoying the freedom to work and travel throughout the Union . National authorities need to intensify the follow-up of complaints . Passengers using international transport by rail and sea will benefit from similar rights under forthcoming legislation . Coach travel would also benefit from greater attention to quality of service . Quality of service is an important competitive asset in all modes . Attention should be paid to increasing effective access to transport for passengers with reduced mobility .
As to climate , according to J. Papadakis , the area is characterised by winters of type Avena Cálido ( warm oats ) , except in the north-east where , under the influence of the zone of Gredos , they become type Avena Fresco ( cold oats ) . Summers are of the type Maíz ( maize ) . Average annual rainfall varies between 600 and 1300 mm , making the area a transition zone between a wet and a dry Mediterranean climate .
4.7.3.3 The EESC considers that any action for the revision of care services should promote independent living for people with disabilities . A specific objective on de-institutionalisation and development of community-based alternatives should be part of the new strategy on long term care , as well as part of the new social protection strategy . The alternatives should include initiatives such as personal assistants , assistive devices , support services , information , coaching , inclusion of disabled people in their own care provision , etc .
( 4 ) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates . It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without , however , preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts . The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met .
( 138 ) The volume of imports from Israel rose steadily from around 3 600 tonnes in 2001 to around 4 800 tonnes in the IP . The market share held by imports from Israel increased from 1,3 % in 2001 to 1,9 % in the IP . Import prices from Israel declined from around 2 000 EUR / tonne in 2001 to around 1 800 EUR / tonne in the IP . Again , the Israeli export price during the IP is slightly below import prices from India .

Any information relating to the matter , any request for a hearing or for a questionnaire as well as any request for authorisation of certificates of non-circumvention must be made in writing ( not in electronic format , unless otherwise specified ) , must indicate the name , address , e-mail address , telephone , fax and / or telephone numbers and should be sent to the following address : European Commission Trade Directorate-General
7 . Notes that at the end of the period covered by the OLAF report 55 investigations were under way in the new Member States and accession countries ; most of those investigations were concentrated in the external aid , cigarette and agriculture sectors ; emphasises , in that connection , the valuable role played by the Anti-Fraud Coordination Service ;
Following early contributions from the United States and other countries , the European Community , recognising that the objectives of the IFI were a reflection of those pursued by itself , wished to give practical support to the initiative . It began contributing to the IFI in 1989 . EC funding now represents approximately 48 % of annual contributions to the Fund and 40 % of cumulative contributions to date . The Commission has been represented by an observer at all IFI Board meetings since the beginning of 1989 .
( 1 ) The United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances adopted in Vienna on 19 December 1988 , hereinafter referred to as the &amp; quot ; United Nations Convention &amp; quot ; , is part of the worldwide effort to combat illegal drugs . Within its sphere of competence , the Community participated in the negotiation and concluded the Convention on behalf of the Community by means of Council Decision 90 / 611 / EEC &amp; # 91 ; 1 &amp; # 93 ; .
( 19 ) The rural development programmes are financed from the Community budget on the basis of commitments in annual instalments . Member States must be able to draw on the Community funds provided for as soon as they begin the programmes . A suitably restricted prefinancing system ensuring a steady flow of funds so that payments to beneficiaries under the programmes are made at the appropriate time is therefore needed .
Whereas : ( 1 ) On 28 February 2005 the Council authorised the Commission to enter into negotiations with the Republic of Croatia to amend the preferential arrangements as regards imports of sugar originating in Croatia into the Community under the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States , of the one part , and the Republic of Croatia , of the other part &amp; # 91 ; 1 &amp; # 93 ; , approved by Council and Commission Decision 2005 / 40 / EC , Euratom &amp; # 91 ; 2 &amp; # 93 ; .

83 . The productivity of the English and French translation units at the EP is systematically below average ( by 5 to 20 % , depending on the year ) whereas productivity differences among the other EU-15 languages are limited to 10 % . This is explained by the French unit ’ s higher-than-average number of translators coupled with an above-average outsourcing of translations . For the English unit there is a lower need for translations as most internal documents are drafted in English . Outsourcing levels and overcapacities are factors open to management decisions .
( 9 ) Payment requests from the Member States under the new agricultural regulations will be concentrated overwhelmingly at the beginning of the budget year n . Therefore the maximum threshold for advance commitments against the EAGF ( from 15 November of year n-1 ) to cover routine management expenditure ( charged to the budget of the year n ) should be removed with regard to the last adopted agricultural budget . As regards the limit on advance commitment of administrative expenditure , the text should be amended so that it refers to appropriations decided by the budget authority .
Knowledge arising from work carried out under direct actions may be made available to one or more interested legal entities , in particular to those established in a Member State or an Associated State , provided that the said legal entities undertake to use the knowledge or to ensure that it is used . Such availability of knowledge shall be subject to appropriate conditions to be laid down and published by the Commission , in particular concerning the payment of fees .
Whereas future consideration should be given to the development of seat strength requirements specific to M2 vehicles , based on experience and accident research . Whereas future consideration should be given to the performance of seats subject to the combined loading of a restrained occupant and an unrestrained passenger behind ; whereas a research programme should be undertaken in the next two years with a view to developing a new static seat test procedure which provides an equivalent level of safety compared with the existing dynamic test ;
1 . The following provisions shall apply where products or certain aspects of products have not yet been harmonized at Community level : ( a ) if a Member State proposes to agree that compliance with its national technical regulations and standards shall be determined on the basis of tests , certificates or marks issued by the competent authorities of a third country under its procedures , it shall so inform the Commission and the other Member States , stating its reasons ;
77 . The Commission considered that the decision adopting the fee scale was an independent act of a prescriptive character for which the Association , acting as an association of undertakings , was wholly responsible . Furthermore , the Commission concluded that the Association intended to coordinate its members ’ behaviour in the market through its decisions laying down and amending the scale . The Commission also found that the scale was applied at least to some extent .
common position of the Council on the adoption of a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation ( EEC ) No 1408 / 71 on the application of social security schemes to employed persons , to self-employed persons and to members of their families moving within the Community and Council Regulation ( EEC ) No 574 / 72 laying down the procedure for implementing Regulation ( EEC ) No 1408 / 71 ( miscellaneous amendments )
2 . In accordance with Article 22 ( 2 ) of Regulation ( EC ) No 1260 / 1999 , the scope of the operations referred to in paragraph 1 ( a ) of this Article shall be extended , by a Decision for Fund participation , to measures that may be financed under Regulations ( EC ) No 1783 / 1999 , ( EC ) No 1257 / 1999 and ( EC ) No 1263 / 1999 , so as to cover all the measures necessary for the implementation of the innovative actions in question .
3.2.2.2 The EESC considers that the Commission could have been more innovative &amp; # 91 ; 9 &amp; # 93 ; and that the new proposals could have been better developed &amp; # 91 ; 10 &amp; # 93 ; . The EESC drew the Commission &amp; apos ; s attention to a number of shortcomings , which still exist , when it drew up its opinion on Consumer Policy Strategy 2002-2006 &amp; # 91 ; 11 &amp; # 93 ; . More recently , it adopted an own-initiative opinion which explored and expanded on this issue , to the conclusions of which the reader is referred &amp; # 91 ; 12 &amp; # 93 ; .

1 . The Commission shall represent the Community in the Joint Committee provided for in Article 14 of the Agreement , and in the Joint Sectoral Committees established by the Sectoral Annexes , assisted by the special committee designated by the Council . The Commission shall proceed , after consultation with this special committee , to the appointments , notifications , exchange of information and the requests for verifications referred to in Articles 10 ( b ) , 12 , 13 , and 14 ( 2 ) of the Agreement and the equivalent provisions of its Sectoral Annexes .

( 78 ) As regards imports into the Community originating in Algeria , since they are still made at dumped prices , and also on the above analysis of spare capacities and the comparison of price levels , dumping from Algeria is likely to continue in the future . Given that the Community was the only export market for Algeria during the RIP , it is highly likely that Algerian exporters would direct their increased export volumes mainly to this market .
3.2 The Committee welcomes the CIP as an important step towards establishing synergies to promote business competitiveness and innovation and to foster sustainable development . The proposed measures and tools can play a key part in strengthening social cohesion , promoting sustainable economic development and achieving the Lisbon strategy &amp; apos ; s growth and employment objectives . This is why the Commission also highlights the CIP as an important element of Community policy in its proposed action plan to revitalise the Lisbon strategy at Community level ( COM ( 2005 ) 330 ) .
( 1 ) Several distinct transmissible spongiform encephalopathies ( TSEs ) have for a number of years been recognised as occurring separately in humans and animals . Bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( BSE ) was first recognised in bovine animals in 1986 and in the following years was recognised as occurring in other species of animal . A new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease ( CJD ) was described in 1996 . Evidence continues to grow of the similarity between the BSE agent and that of the new variant of Creutzfeld-Jakob Disease .
( 14 ) The certification of training provision should be regarded , in terms of safety , as one of the decisive factors contributing to the quality of training . Training should be seen as a service similar to air navigation services , also subject to a certification process . This Directive should make it possible to certify training by type of training , by package of training services or by package of training and air navigation services , without losing sight of the particular characteristics of training .
( 17 ) Contamination of food with cadmium is of public health concern . Accumulation of cadmium in animal tissue is function of dietary concentration and duration of exposure . The short life span of animals like fattening pigs and poultry minimizes the risk of undesirable cadmium concentrations in edible tissues of these animals Ruminants and horses however may be exposed during their entire lifespan to cadmium present in pastures . In distinct regions this may result in an undesirable cadmium accumulation particularly in kidneys .
3.1.5 One of the arguments used for extending the reference period is that it would give firms more flexibility to manage working time . This flexibility already exists in many countries , thanks to collective agreements , and the problem of poor flexibility tends to affect countries where collective agreements have traditionally played a less significant role . It would be worthwhile to seek to strengthen collective agreements on the issue of working time , particularly in those countries where such agreements are not especially strong .
( 4 ) The management measures for raw cane sugar produced in the French overseas departments and qualifying for the additional basic aid should be the same as those laid down by Commission Regulation ( EC ) No 1554 / 2001 of 30 July 2001 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation ( EC ) No 1260 / 2001 as regards marketing sugar produced in the French overseas departments and for equalising the price conditions with preferential raw sugar ( 4 ) .
( 303 ) The Commission further examined the injurious effects of the costs of restructuring which the Community producers have undergone in recent years . In this respect it is noted that restructuring will as a rule imply short term costs such as redundancy payments , acquisition costs , etc . , which are outweighed by medium term efficiency gains . In view of the ongoing rationalisation process , this would imply that ongoing short term costs , even if found to be minor , impacted on the cost structure .

As regards public health , the implementation of the upgrading programme for the agri-food establishments is on-going . The number of “ non-compliant establishments without an upgrading plan ” has been considerably reduced . This is a sign of good progress and the current pace of upgrading should be maintained . Preparations should be stepped up to improve the management of the collection and treatment of non-compliant raw milk . The legislation on direct sales remains to be completed .
( 393 ) The Commission notes however that since the time BE encountered difficulties , winter forward prices have very much increased . Various price reporting agencies have reported values above GBP 20 / MWh for winter baseload prices in the next few years , even reaching figures as high as GBP 27 / MWh &amp; # 91 ; 60 &amp; # 93 ; . The upward trend seems to be continuing and sustainable . New entrant costs estimates range between GBP 20 / MWh and GBP 25 / MWh &amp; # 91 ; 61 &amp; # 93 ; .
1.2 The key drivers for this draft directive are : 1 ) the inclusion of a specific reference to terrorist financing , although this was agreed by Member States under the previous directive to be include within the concept of serious offences , and 2 ) to take account of the revised Forty Recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering ( FATF ) &amp; # 91 ; 1 &amp; # 93 ; published in June 2003 .
In support of its claims , the applicant also alleges that the contested decision infringes Article 53 of the EC Treaty , Article 6 of Regulation No 1784 / 1999 , the rules laid down in Notice No COM ( 2000 ) 894 final &amp; # 91 ; 2 &amp; # 93 ; and also the rules established by the Commission in the context of its call for proposals &amp; # 91 ; 3 &amp; # 93 ; . Last , the applicant maintains that the Commission has made a manifest error of assessment of the facts , has misused its powers and has infringed the principle of legal certainty .

For the purposes of this Directive , the expression % quot % rights-management information % quot % means any information provided by rightholders which identifies the work or other subject-matter referred to in this Directive or covered by the sui generis right provided for in Chapter III of Directive 96 / 9 / EC , the author or any other rightholder , or information about the terms and conditions of use of the work or other subject-matter , and any numbers or codes that represent such information .
( 2 ) Each Member State shall afford two or more lawyers from the same grouping or the same home Member State who practise in its territory under their home-country professional titles access to a form of joint practice . If the host Member State gives its lawyers a choice between several forms of joint practice , those same forms shall also be made available to the aforementioned lawyers . The manner in which such lawyers practise jointly in the host Member State shall be governed by the laws , regulations and administrative provisions of that State .
Whereas , in the absence of such provisions , Council Regulation ( EEC ) No 2358 / 71 of 26 October 1971 on the common organization of the market in seeds ( 5 ) , as last amended by Regulation ( EEC ) No 1346 / 78 ( 6 ) and Council Regulation ( EEC ) No 1035 / 72 of 18 May 1972 on the common organization of the market in fruit and vegetables ( 7 ) , as last amended by Regulation ( EEC ) No 1766 / 78 ( 8 ) , should be supplemented accordingly ;
( 1 ) Article 3 of Commission Regulation ( EEC ) No 411 / 88 of 12 February 1988 on the method and the rate of interest to be used for calculating the costs of financing intervention measures comprising buying-in , storage and disposal &amp; # 91 ; 2 &amp; # 93 ; , lays down that the uniform interest rate used for calculating the costs of financing intervention measures is to correspond to the three-month and 12-month forward Euribor rates with a weighting of one third and two thirds respectively .
5.2.1 Given the lack of any specific legal instruments for public health protection , some European Union countries have tended to skirt around the problem , sometimes employing dubious practices , often involving improper use of social security regulations , because this enables them to mix up health and economic issues in the same debate . While it is legitimate to appreciate the cost of healthcare and to make the most rational use of the limited resources available , it is nevertheless dangerous to confuse the two issues .
In 1991 , the applicants , who are officials of the European Parliament , transferred to the Community scheme the pension rights which they had acquired in Italy before entering the service of the Communities . The difference between the actual number of years of affiliation to the Italian scheme and the number of annuities resulting from the calculation of the premium in the Community scheme was determined in accordance with the general implementing provisions then applied by the Parliament , which did not align the premium with the number of years of affiliation in Italy .
2.5 . Coordination in the fight against terrorist financing is likely to be facilitated where the FIU includes a dedicated CFT unit facilitating closer coordination with CFT and CT experts in other Relevant Actors . Focused CFT experts within the FIU also ensure a greater awareness of CFT typologies and so facilitate identification and prioritisation of high risk cases . These expert units should ensure a multi-agency approach through structured coordination with police , prosecutors and intelligence services . Such units should be encouraged to compare approaches with their counterparts in other Member States .
The EU and the Pacific ACP countries &amp; # 91 ; 1 &amp; # 93 ; can look back on more than 30 years of cooperation in the context of the EU-ACP partnership . This long-standing relationship is based on the legacy of a shared history , common values , economic and trade cooperation . Today , developments on both sides warrant renewal of this partnership and establishment of a fully-fledged strategy on the Pacific ACP countries . There are compelling reasons for proposing this first ever EU strategy for the Pacific .
The key objective of the Community Strategic Guidelines for Cohesion is to provide Member States with guidance for the preparation of the National Strategic Reference Frameworks , with a view to ensuring that the programmes co-financed by the Funds are in line with the priority policy areas defined at Community level , in particular , to help deliver the Lisbon agenda for growth and jobs . In light of the above and of the renewed Lisbon strategy for growth and jobs , programmes co-financed through the cohesion policy should seek to target resources on the following three priorities :
( 2 ) Commission Decision 2004 / 407 / EC of 26 April 2004 on transitional sanitary and certification rules under Regulation ( EC ) No 1774 / 2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards import from certain third countries of photographic gelatine &amp; # 91 ; 2 &amp; # 93 ; provides , by way of derogation from that prohibition in Regulation ( EC ) No 1774 / 2002 , that France , the Netherlands and the United Kingdom are to authorise the import of certain gelatine exclusively intended for the photographic industry ( photographic gelatine ) .
( 1 ) The local Council of Haaksbergen , located in the province Overijssel close to the German border , wished to revitalise the neglected centre of its town already since the beginning of the nineties . At the end of the nineties , 6 building companies acquired the pieces of land concerned , grouped together and , since they did not consider it as profitable , proposed to the local Council to support their project consisting in the building of 58 apartments and 11 locations for retail shops .
Pursuant to Article 2 of EU Council Regulation ( EC ) No 851 / 2005 amending Regulation ( EC ) No 539 / 2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement as regards the reciprocity mechanism , Latvia would like to notify the Council and the Commission that the Federative Republic of Brazil continue to apply unilateral visa regime to the citizens of the Republic of Latvia .
2 . If a Member State finds that vehicles , systems , separate technical units or components do not conform to the approved type , it may request the Member State which has conducted the type-approval to verify the irregularities found . Any Member State which has conducted type-approval shall conduct the necessary check within six months following the date of receipt of that request . Should a failure to conform be established , the competent authorities in the Member State which has conducted type-approval shall take the measures set out in paragraph 1 .
2.4.2 The Charter of Fundamental Rights is seen as marking a step forward as it incorporates , without breaking them down into separate categories , all types of individual and collective rights ( civil and political rights and social and economic rights ) . It also adopts an innovatory approach by recognising more &amp; quot ; contemporary &amp; quot ; civil rights ( linked to sustainable development , consumer protection , gender equality , bioethics , the protection of personal data , etc . ) .
&amp; # 91 ; 36 &amp; # 93 ; See Case T-17 / 93 Matra-Hachette SA v Commission , &amp; # 91 ; 1994 &amp; # 93 ; ECR II-595 , paragraph 34 . The Court ruled that the rights of third parties , as laid down by Article 19 of the Council Regulation No 17 of 6.2.1962 ( now replaced by Article 27 of Regulation ( EC ) No 1 / 2003 ) , were limited to the right to participate in the administrative procedure .

( 12 ) Enforcement of the obligations with regard to the sulphur content of marine fuels is necessary to achieve the aims of this Directive . Effective sampling and dissuasive penalties throughout the Community are necessary to ensure credible implementation of this Directive . Member States should take enforcement action with respect to vessels flying their flag and to vessels of all flags while in their ports . It is also appropriate for Member States to cooperate closely to take additional enforcement action with respect to other vessels in accordance with international maritime law .
82 . Recalls that the reform places a strong emphasis on the decentralisation of financial controls ; believes that this in turn highlights the urgent need to develop more suitable and accountable forms of central management supervision of the control systems operating in individual departments ; takes the view that this central management supervision should result in a formal opinion on the quality of the departments &amp; apos ; internal control systems , which should be published in its original form within the synthesis report ;
3 . First processors who have taken over the raw materials from applicants shall inform their competent authorities of the quantities of raw materials received , specifying the species , the name and address of the party to the contract who delivered the raw materials , the place of delivery and the contract reference , within a time limit to be set by the Member States that allows the payments to be made within the period specified in Article 28 of Regulation ( EC ) No 1782 / 2003 .
4.14 On the other hand , gender budgets — i.e. application of gender mainstreaming to the budget procedure — are still virtually unknown at European level and in the Member States . Introducing the gender dimension at every level of budget planning is an acknowledgement that administrators &amp; apos ; decisions are not neutral but have different impacts on men and women ; in this sense gender budgeting is also an instrument for evaluating the impact of policies , funding and taxation on men and women .
( 4 ) For the purpose of implementation of Article 1 of Council Directive 89 / 130 / EEC , Euratom on the harmonisation of the compilation of gross national product at market prices &amp; # 91 ; 4 &amp; # 93 ; , the economic territory of Member States is defined by Commission Decision 91 / 450 / EEC , Euratom &amp; # 91 ; 5 &amp; # 93 ; . The equivalent definition should now be provided in respect of GNI .
Future technologies for widespread use in the second half of this century still need to be developed . Unfortunately , since the early 1980 ’ s IEA Members have halved their energy-related research and technology development budgets . This trend needs to be reversed in the EU if it wants to improve its competitiveness in these markets . Therefore , budgets for climate , energy , transport and production and consumption research need to be increased significantly in the upcoming 7th Framework Programme . International co-operation to develop breakthrough technologies must be enhanced with the help of public-private partnerships .
( 1 ) On 23 May 2005 , the Council strongly condemned the &amp; quot ; reported excessive , disproportionate and indiscriminate use of force by the Uzbek security forces in Andijan , Eastern Uzbekistan &amp; quot ; , earlier that month . The Council expressed its deep regret regarding the failure of the Uzbek authorities to respond adequately to the United Nations &amp; apos ; call for an independent international inquiry . On 13 June 2005 , it urged these authorities to reconsider their position by the end of June 2005 .
( 4 ) Scrutiny of the flavouring substances notified by Member States and laid down in Decision 1999 / 217 / EC revealed a number of inconsistencies in the chemical numbers , names , synonyms and systematic names and identified a number of cases where the same substances appeared under different chemical names in the register . These inconsistencies should be corrected . Where for those inconsistencies for which no final conclusion could be reached at this stage , at least the fact of a possible inconsistency should be mentioned .

The importance of information on the right to non-discrimination was a key finding of the public consultation organised by the Commission in 2004 in connection with the Green Paper on Equality and non-discrimination in an enlarged EU &amp; # 91 ; 8 &amp; # 93 ; . There is little point in protecting legal rights if people do not know about them , and this is recognised in Article 10 of the Directive , which requires the Member States to bring to the attention of all persons concerned the provisions of national law adopted pursuant to the Directive .
4 . The purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council Regulation ( EEC ) No 4060 / 89 of 21 December 1989 on the elimination of controls performed at the frontiers of Member States in the field of road and inland waterway transport &amp; # 91 ; 3 &amp; # 93 ; . The new Regulation will supersede the acts incorporated in it &amp; # 91 ; 4 &amp; # 93 ; ; this proposal fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bringing them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself .
3 . The third plea concerns the infringement of Article 88 EC and Article 19 of Regulation No 659 / 1999 . It is alleged that the actual measures contained in the Commission Decision of 3 December 1997 adopted in relation to the contract for the provision of maritime services entered into between Transmediterránea and the Kingdom of Spain in 1978 entailed the abolition of the State aid scheme contained therein and precluded its continuance in relation to the Canary Isles lines .
( 6 ) Water is ingested directly or indirectly like other foods , thereby contributing to the overall exposure of a consumer to ingested substances , including chemical and microbiological contaminants . However , as the quality of water intended for human consumption is already controlled by Council Directives 80 / 778 / EEC ( 5 ) and 98 / 83 / EC ( 6 ) , it suffices to consider water after the point of compliance referred to in Article 6 of Directive 98 / 83 / EC .
( 7 ) To guarantee better implementation of the new programming period as regards agri-environment and animal welfare , Member States should be allowed to authorise the transformation of an agri-environmental or animal welfare commitment entered into on the basis of Regulation ( EC ) No 1257 / 1999 into a new commitment for a period of between five to seven years as a general rule under Regulation ( EC ) No 1698 / 2005 provided that the new commitment is beneficial to the environment or to animal welfare .
