can i wear t-shirt and jeans for the job interview .
i've got it . i think i will wear a white shirt with a tie .
i don ' t think i can do that .
in short , you should present the best of yourself throughout .
sure . firstly , it is very important for you to be punctual . interviewers usually don't think much of a candidate who comes 5 or 10 minutes late only to explain that he could not find the place or he was stuck in traffic .
first , you need to create a good image in the limited time .
i think you should make some preparations . for example , you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed . what's more , try to avoid a too casual style .
the antiques market here in paris is very famous . it's called le mar che aux puces de saint-ouen .

that ' s very important . i ' ll try to make a good impression .
i think the most important thing is to have a good image .

sorry , i know . fast food is so popular in this district .
that's true .
you did ? i thought you must felt right at home here as we get as many fast food restaurants as you do in america .
i guess you're right . more often than not , people went there only for convenience . the foods may taste good , but generally speaking , they are high in calories , salt and fat .
you bet . almost all top brands such as mcdonald's and kfc is from america .
seriously , i don't like them .

that's a good idea .
we could go to more places this time . if you liked .

thank you very much .
i'm sorry to hear that .
i don't think it was worth that money .
well , can you explain it to me .
that's fine . i can tell you right now .
i'm so glad to hear about it .
but if you placed a larger order , we would increase the discount to 10 percent .
you get what you pay for , considering the high quality . our price is very reasonable .
i can't agree with you . the price is too high .
15 % is impossible . that'll leave us almost no profit ?

you need to make sure that your product is in good condition .
and i would say the logo is successful mainly because it comesfrom japan . it is the japanese that have made it a fad .
yes , if people can't communicate with each other easily , they can not understand each other's way of thinking .
in foreign trade , exporters need to know the social characteristics of people he is dealing with .
how are i supposed to do this ?
i think it's a very complicated issue . a part of the difficulties women have advancing in the work force are due to few opportunities and many male managers . don't underestimate the good ole ' boy system . men have power , so it's easier for them to
i think we should be in accordance with national conditions .

i graduated from songhua university .
i graduated from peking university in 2008 .
project management . i was very interested in this course when i was a student . and i think it's very useful for my present work .
i've taking courses on office administration , reports and correspondence writing . i think all these are closely related to the job of assistant manager , because it requires the ability to perform general office work and to assist the manager

quite often . it is very convenient . saving me a lot of time .
you are asking the right person . here are two very important tips . first , you need to visit no more than one site to find the best products and prices . i can recommend you some online merchants .

excuse me , could i help you ?
not much . i am still living at home and commuting to school . i ended up dropping that metalworking class i was so excited about . it just wasn't as interesting as i'd hoped . the guidance counselor suggested that i focus on my prerequisite courses so that i can make sure

no . everyone has a chance to correct his or her mistake . the most important thing is to be responsible for your work .

would you like to help me ?
can you tell me how to get to the bank ?
this is our rock-bottom price and we can't make any further reduction .
then , what's your countr- offer ?
we are sincere to make business with you , but the difference between your counter-offer and our prices is too great .
how about meeting each other half-way in order to conclude a business ?
thank you for allowing me 3 % reduction , but still we find your price is on the high side .
if so , we find it difficult for us to go on with the talks .
to conclude the deal , i'd say .
so are we , our counter-offer is in line with our world market .
i agree with you .
can you tell me how to get to the supermarket ?
you know that the most important meal of the day ?
do you have anything else to eat ?
no , i don't .
i usually have a bowl of milk .
i don't usually have any .
yes . it is .
what's your favorite food ?
the most important meal of the day ?
can you tell me how to get to the bank ?
it is not an easy job , how do you like the advertisement for the new product ?
i don't think so .
that is very encouraging news . i heard that the marketing department has done a three months research , they sent the feedback information to the research and development center by the end of every month . that is to say , the r & d center redesigned the product twice before it was released
that is the best one i have seen . i am sure our target customer , young people will love it .
hello . can i help you , sir ?
fantastic ! is there any charge ?
i'm only making one copy , i guess i can afford it .
there's a copy machine on the first floor at our computer lab , sir .
the price per copy is five cents .

i don't think so .
i didn ' t see that .
take a no . 2 . this is .
it's going to be finished by next month .
let me see . i think there are two seats .
i didn ' t know it would be big .
i didn ' t know it would be .
good morning . may i help you , sir ?
i know , but i'm going to enroll in my night school to take a course in business management .
no . it probably means they have a large apartment . probably a living room , kitchen and threebedroom . they need someone for the empty bedroom .
that's true . i know that there are plenty of popular restaurants and coffee shops around there .
i think i'd like to move to the city .
excuse me , can i help you , please ?
that ' s very good . i once turn down a job offers just because the office is awful .
small rooms . small window , a small desk shared by three people . i would have been interrupted all the time and for sure not be able to deliver good work .
i agree . by the way , the number of the telephone on your desk is extensions 506 . you can pick up your office supplies from the supply room at the end of the corridor .
well , i love it . the room is special and clean with big windows and a lot of sunshine .
what was so bad about it ?
sounds bad ! lucky you ! i didn ' t take that job . i think a good office environment is also important to work efficiently .
excuse me . can i help you , sir ?
yes , i ' m pleased to see that you have got a distinction .
well , it look like his encouragement paid off rebecca . so how about extracurricular activities at university ?
what was that involve ?
i ' m sure . okay , now let ' s move on to my work experience , shall we ?
yes , that ' s right . after graduating from high school in new york i attended york university in the uk . my major was english , and my minor was business studies .
yes , that ' s right . i ' ve always enjoyed studying . my friends say i ' m a bit of a bookworm , but my father always pushed us to succeed .
well i ' ve always been keen on writing , so i became a editor for the university student newspaper , which i really loved . also i volunteered for a group called shelter , to help the homeless in york .
providing warm meals and Shelter , especially in the winter months . i found it really fulfilling to be part of that group .
yes , ok .
excuse me , may i help you ?
i'd like to try this one on .
yes , here you are .
would you like me to change it ?
would you like me to change them ?
i don't know what to do now .
when did you last time have your eyes check ?
it's not only about getting fat or not . it's about being healthy . you could really have some health problems later on .
i've been having headaches almost every day . and i am not getting as much sleep as i usually do .
yes , i feel weak .
i want to lower my risk of stroke , too .
excuse me , sir . can i help you ?
yes , i do .
i don ' t know where i am .
you are right here , bus station . we are in the center of the city .
i work in a cubicle too , but i do not mind it .
i don ' t know what the problem is .
i'd like to buy a new car .
the 19:00 train , please .
i'm jim .
all right . what kind would you like ?
how long will it take ?
can i help you , sir ?
will you be voting ?
who did you vote for ?
what do you think about him ?
i ' m sure you will .
i am going to be voting .
i don ' t know .

he ' s very handsome .
i think he ' s a good choice .
i am going to be voting .

excuse me , can i help you , please ?
what do you find difficult to work with ?
what kind of people did you find difficult to work with ?
i think it's time for you to check in . if you run into any difficulties , we'll be here to assist you immediately .
what do you think of your colleagues ?
what do you think is the most important thing in your job ?
that ' s a good idea .
i like a person who work hard . i don ' t like lazy people .
well , the most important thing in communication is your sincerity .
she taught us . you can do anything that you want to do .
i don't think so . i think the most important thing for me is to learn .
working under pressure is exciting and challenging . i don ' t mind . in fact , i am very efficient when certain pressure are exerted on the work .
it's pretty simple , iris . just keep it in mind that you ' re what you eat .
what do you think of your colleagues ?
excuse me , sir . can i help you ?
let me see . no , you have to include more details about your final conclusion , for example , your experiences in dealing with some emergent events .
you need to get some rest , as you have to getting up early in the morning .
yes , i did , but i didn't .
that's a good idea . i don't know what to do .
good morning . may i help you , sir ?
delighted i was able to help .
by this time , it's better . the rush hr is over .
i am sorry to hear that . i didn't know .
he told me he was going to call me .
would you like me to help you ?
some chinese food . i'm hungry , and there ' s a take-out restaurant near here . we can have them deliver and then watch the news on tv while we eat .
okay . i could go for that . it's called al's steakhouse . they also have great fried fish , and i love their salad bar . you can go back to refill her plate as often as
yeah , their steaks are enormous . sometimes i can't finish what i've ordered .
don't worry , we'll just get a doggie bag .
what do you want ?
no , i'll rather go out . the chinese food here is rather different from what i had at home . maybe we can try some other food today ... what about that all-you-can-eat place we passed the other day ?
is that the place that served such large portions of meat ?
what if that happens to me . i hate to let food go to waste .
can you tell me how to get to the bank ?
oh , the company is the fourth largest machine producer in the world . it was founded in the united states in 1980 . i know the company has made good use of advanced technology .
yeah , well , i fill you in the details then .
i'm not sure . i don ' t know .
i think that they are trying to find out how to improve our management skills .
you know , i often overhear our neighbor , the young couple , fighting about how to raise their kid and i don't want kids to spoil our happiness .
excuse me , may i help you , sir ?
i see , may i ask what the occasion is .
very well . this arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . it has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out .
mmm , well this is our ' i ' m sorry i cheated on you ' package . two dozen red roses lined with tulips , carnations and lilies . the fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you .
i ' m sorry sir but , what exactly do you do ?
get out of my store . you jerk !
i would like to buy some flowers , please , something really nice .
it ' s not really an occasion , it ' s more like i am sorry .
i think i ' m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear . what other do you recommend ?
i don ' t think that ' s gonna cut it . i need something big and better !
well , i may have accidentally insinuating that she is getting chubbier .
can you tell me how to get to the bank ?
please . and in the mean time , can i look at apartments available in a area from this office ?
thank you , henry . i'll get a number 13 .
i'll put you on a waiting list .
i'm sorry . i didn't know that .
yeah . yeah , yeah . many times . when i was younger , you used to get double-decker all over england but now i only tend to see them in the big cities .
i'll put you on a waiting list , please .
i'm not sure .
can you tell me how to get to the university ?
so , if the cause is poverty , there should be a programme to make the country richer . if the problem is resource , share them .
yeah . it is . one way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . wars are very expensive .
i don ' t think that there is any easy way . the united nations could send peacekeepers into the country . at least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate .
it sounds easier when you say it like that . in reality , it's harder to make peace between countries .
excuse me . may i help you ?
i ' m sorry , mr . myers . i ' m really sorry .
that ' s all right . bring me over what you ' ve been .
yes . after so many years of hard work , i ' d rather i had an officeof my own .

okay , then . we'll be back around noon .
yes . that's fine . we can book you a private room for up to ten people at that time .
how are you doing ?
don ' t worry . that ' s just a part of being an teenager .
you should encourage her to make up her mind by herself . you shouldn ' t affect her decision .
oh , her can make her own decisions .
believe me . everything will be ok . !
i'm worried about my daughter . she can ' t decide about college .
i don ' t mind that . but her disagrees with me about everything .
but i just wants to give her some tips .
i suppose you are right .
i believe so .
i don't know what to do .
we have discount coupons . 100 yuan for ten times . would you like a one ?
what's the name of the lake ?
yes . it's very beautiful .
it'll take about half an hour .
good morning . can i help you ?
well , it is getting very late . i think we should go home .
i think we should go home .
what is you talking about ? we'll split the bill .
no way , gordon . i know that you are a little short on cash at the moment . there's no need for you to pay for the whole bill .
that's better . this way we will both have money to take a cab home . otherwise , you would probably have to walk .
you've got an deal .
that's fine .
it sure was . i wouldn't eat another bite .
you're right . i have to got up early to go to work tomorrow .
don't worry about that . tonight is my treat .

excuse me . can i help you ?

i apologize for this mess . they've got me handling so many projects , and it's hard to keep things organized .
maybe you are right . i don't think so .
not really , so long asyou follow all the regulations .
i am very happy to hear that .
i don't know . i'm not sure what to do .
i've been having this problem for a few days .
good morning . can i help you ?

i am sorry . i can't make it .
your reservation is right . please get an ticket booking form from there and fill it .
could you tell me how to get to the office ?
exactly , move your arms in a relaxed manner . well . don't stretch yourfingers stiffly . just keep them in a natural shape .
and those pencils , what should i do with them ?
i see . i think it's a good idea to keep a low profile .
yes and no . let me see if i can clarify that . the terms are the same except that
ideal posture is to sit straight , not stiff , against the back of the chair .
i know the characteristic of him . so i never think seriously of his words .
i see . i think i'll keep a low profile .
ah , you changed so fast . ?
can you tell me how to get to the supermarket ?
i am sorry to hear that . i am not sure .

how much is they ?
i've take them .
can you tell me how to get to the office ?
well , just some in general , like several key steps in planning career and how to set specific and tenable goals .
making a decision to start over is not an easy thing to do . it seems that you need this course more than i do . i love my current job . if i take this course . i hope to learn some tricks to get myself more organized at work .
i think it is good if we know enough about career planning . we will make wiser choices . what else did he tell you about it ?
sounds practical ! to be honest , sometimes i feel puzzled about my future career . i am not sure if this job suits me the best though i work very hard on it and enjoy being a hard worker . i have always wanted to try something else and
ok , then i can sign up for it together .
hello . can i help you ?
ok , i'll do it .
it's for you , mike .
can you tell me how to get to the supermarket ?
do you have a reservation ?
here you are .
no , i don't .
three , please .
excuse me . can i help you ?
are you saying that all my results was normal ?
what will i learn when i read the results on the website ?
i will be able to see the results .
can i see all of the test results at once ?
i didn't see anything out of the ordinary , but i want you to log onto our website for a printout of all of the details .
i don ' t think i ' m sure .
the purpose of each test is given on the website .
you will be able to see the results on the website .
yes , you can see each test for the past five years . you can compare them .
excuse me . can i help you ?
what i mean is that we'll never be able to come up to your price . the gap is too great .
i don't think we'll be able to meet each other halfway .
do you mean to suggestthat we have to make a further reduction of 50 dollars in our price ? that's impossible .
the best we can do will be a reduction of another 30 dollars . that's definitely be rock bottom .
you certainly have a way of talking me into it . allright , let's meet half way again .
alright , i ' ll buy the one .
i think it unwise for either of us to insist on his own price . how about meeting each other half way ?
i think to get your business done , you should at least reduce the price by 20 % .
what would you suggest ?
that still leaves a gap of 20 dollars to be covered . let's meet each other half way once more , then the gap will be closed and
hello . can i help you , sir ?
yes , what time would you like a wake- up call ?
i am sorry , but i am not sure .
yeah . that's the one .
i saw a program a few months ago about how animals are raised for human consumption . i haven't been able to eat asingle piece of meat since .
thank you , mary .
excuse me . can i help you ?
i haven't seen you in a while .
here you go .
you mean the one with the yellow bricks ? but last time i saw it ,
no , i don't think so .
i will see you .
good morning . may i help you , sir ?
excellent . we will meet all your conditions if you can meet our demands ?
what are you going to do ?
six have been seriously affected , but i'm also migrating to several surrounding countries .
we have a lot of raw materials in our production .
we ' re not allowed to use lead .
can i help you , sir ?
we'll have to discuss it with her .
yes , i've been feeling better .
ok , here you are .
hello . may i help you , sir ?
no problem , sir . everything will be already when you come back .
yes , please . we ' re on my way out . i can put up make up sign on . could you bring us some towels and hangers .
can you tell me how to use the internet ?
what are the reasons for this ?
well , i do prefer the lower emission cars as long as it doesn't cost much . some environmentally-friendly cars are really expensive .
i think the most important thing is the quality of the products .
excuse me . may i help you , please ?
he says kick mommy , beat mummy , don ' t want mommy very quickly if i do something that he doesn ' t like . you know , if i wash his face or change his clothes , things like that .
yes . but sometimes he is just not reasonable .
it ' s hard to say , but i will try .
i know my parents sometimes threaten to punished him . but this doesn ' t work , instead he picks up another bad habit .
what word ? can you tell me ?
honey , i don ' t know what to tell you . of course tony is a young child . but do not underestimated his ability to learn and reason .
i suggest you treat him with patience , affection , and respect . if he needs to do something , like go to bed , or be washed , etc . , please guide or help him to get it done .
motivate tony to cooperate by rewarding his good behavior . do not emphasize punishment for bad moods , etc . do Not threaten him with punishment if he resists the actions you desire .
may i help you ?
do you have a appointment ?
i wonder if mr . smith forgot your meeting . i am afraid he left this office this morning and is not expected back until 4 p . m . let me find out if he made arrangements for someone else to meet with you .
would you like to have a seat ?
right this way , mr . mason . we can start with our front office .
yes , i'd like to rent a car .
yes , i'm coming . our meeting is set for 2 o 'clock .
sure . i'll have a seat .
that would be very pleasant . thank you .
can you tell me how to get to the bank ?
i heard that they got into a fight and then decided not to go .
they're also one of the richest couples . they have so many money and they can buy almost anything they want .
did either one of they win an oscar this year ?
tom cruise may be handsome , but i think he's a bit crazy , don't you ?
i still think that that they only got married to get more publicity for their movies and themselves .
i would never want to be a celebrity because the paparazzi would also be after you .
thank goodness i'm not rich and famous !
no , but i heard about the angelina jolie and brad pitt didn't attend .
they must be the most famous celebrities couple in hollywood .
i also heard that tom cruise and katie holmes made an appearance at the oscars .
i think tom might have be nominated for one of his films , but i don't think he won anything .
yes , his marriage to katerie is actually quite scandalous .
people in show biz can have such an easy life , i don't know why they have to make it so complicated .
that's true . i guess it would be difficult to have people taking pictures of you everywhere you went .
being famous , i can do without , but i don't mind being rich .
hello . may i help you , sir ?
i'm sorry , but i can't .
how much do you need ?
how much would you like to exchange ?
all right , here you are .
oh , i see . thank you .

i am sorry to hear that .
i would like to exchange to rib .
i would like it to be 100 rib .
oh , right , here you go .
that's all right .
ok . here you are .
excuse me . may i help you , sir ?
i'm afraid i'm going to get arrested .
excuse me . can i help you , sir ?
well , i prefer to go on the train , but i suppose you want me to take a car .
and i've got to drive . you know i'm not fond of that . i found it much more relaxing to sit in the train .
but very much quicker . but i know we'll never agree on that subject . you prefer the car .
that would be nice . how is you getting there ?
oh , i much prefer to go by car , then we don't need to get to the station with our baggage and ...
don't worry . i'll take the train .
then . have you ever thought of going by express bus ?
can you tell me how to get to the bank ?
yes , this is on our list .
let ' s sign the registry . the realtor looks kind of busy right here .
i am going to take a look at the house .
that ' s a good idea .
yes , i will be home that afternoon .
yes . it is on the list .
that works for me . i can check out the kitchen next .
check out the flyer with all of the home ' s information on it .
that ' s a good idea .
excuse me , sir . can i help you ?
i want to buy a new car .

i'm sorry , madam , i'm sorry .
thank you . i'm a good idea . she likes exciting books . can you suggest another one ?
yes , i'd like to buy a new one .
i see . you haven't got a cold .
yes , i'm afraid it's not .
i don't know , madam .
no , i'm sorry .
can you tell me how to get to the bank ?
i am not sure about the name of the film , but i know it's an romantic one .
don't i think it's too bloody ?
i'd love to .
romantic ? i am afraid i like thrillers much .
on the contrary , very boring .
excuse me . can i help you ?
it was on the 9th .
i didn ' t know it .
i would like to switch to next friday .
tomorrow night would be best for me .
what day was it scheduled for ?
what time was you scheduled ?
i can ' t make it on that day .
yeah , why , is there something going for thursday ?
i will have my assistant check my calendar and get back to you with the exact time . can we bring me an outline of the project when you come ?
hello , may i help you , sir ?
it usually takes 2 to 3 weeks to complete a job with that .
hi , sandy . it's walter knight . i need to book a time with mr . crane .
i didn ' t need it anymore .
hello . can i help you , sir ?
a pleasure meeting you as well ,
thank you . it's a delightful to meet you .
thank you , they is beautiful .
i don't know what to do now .
what do you think of this one ?
you can't be serious !
that's too expensive for me .
you can't go down on the price ?
i'll buy it for $ 2500 .
that's good .
this one is $ 2500 .
that's how much the t . v costs .
this television is of very high value .

oh . this is mike . when will he be back ?
could i leave a message please ?
please tell me i'll call him at the office tomorrow afternoon .
thank you very much .
no . i'm sorry . he has gone out .
she will be back at about seven o'clock .
oh , yes .
all right . i'll tell him when he come back .
excuse me , may i help you , sir ?
i haven't . i just bought one .
i want to buy it for my daughter .
yes . if i don't make it to beijing tomorrow morning . my wife would kill me .
a ten,000 dollar policy shouldn't be too expensive . here , call my agent . he will give you a good deal .
yes , i am .
that's a good idea . you are a fireman and it can be dangerous .
i need to make sure that my wife will be financially secure .
that's true . well , how much do you think i can get ?
excuse me . may i help you , please ?
thanks . what do you need to do now ?
yes , ms . rss ? what do you need ?
i believe you have charged me twice for the same thing . look , the figure of 6 . 5 dollar appears here , then
can i help you , sir ?
i saw her yesterday . her was a little better .
no , you needn't . the number 13 bus will also take you to the hospital .
yes . i caught the number 7 bus yesterday , and they said i had taken a wrong bus .
but number 13 buses leave from the center of town . you'll have to walk two miles to catch one .
i'm going to the hospital to seeing susan .
would you like to go to the doctor ?
number 13 buses run much more commonly , don't they ?
thank you , henry . i'll get a number 15 .
excuse me . may i help you , please ?
thank you , mr . white .
it's just a regular inspection . do you have anything ?
well , the cigarettes and the champagne are not in excess of the dutyfree allowance . but according to our law , each passenger is allowed only one camera duty-free . you'll have to pay duty for the other one
please wait a minute . i'll make out the duty memo ... here you are . take this and pay to a woman over there .

ok , where shall i pay duty for it ?
i've paid for it . here's .
here you go .
hello , can i help you ?
yes , i am .
i observe the interviewer ' manner , mien and gesture carefully besides paying attention to mine .
i ' m sure . i don ' t know what i can do for you .
nice to meet you , too .
does the job require that new employees take any kind of training course ?

i want to see a movie with you .
do you want to go ?
i am thinking about going to the movies .
pretty good . mary , i was wondering if you like to come to a party on friday night ?
what do you want to do ?
would you like to go to the theater with me ?
i was thinking about going to the cinema .
maybe we can see something somewhere between a chick flick and a horror movie !
can you tell me how to get to the bank ?
that's very important . a friend recommended a good law firm to me . we need someone to hire staff .
yeah . we have . we chose the location in the northeast of the city , not too far from the airport and on the edge of the cbd .
the offices there were too expensive . have we negotiated any Contracts yet ?
when will be the branch office open ?
i don ' t think we ' ll be able to do that .
i made plenty of business contract on my last visit and through the embassy . we should be able to get plenty of customer .
first , i'd make sure that we have a good , local , corporate lawyer . he or she will know all the local laws and regulations .
i think that we should send one of our hr people to do that . i don ' t think we should use an agency , because they won ' t be familiar with the type of people we employ . have we decide on the location .
why didn ' t we choose the office in the cbd ?
yes . we ' ve signed two contracts with companies that i already do work for in other countries . we hope to sign another three this month .
maybe next month . everything is a little rushed . we should be able to set up our branch office and expand our business quickly .
yes . it has . we ' re going to target the business community through business magazines .
good afternoon . may i help you ?
what can i do ?

three parties ? that's quite a lot . that must have been expensive !
were your parents upset that they aren't there to see you get married ?
did your husband's family get to meet my family ?
that makes sense . did you go on a honeymoon .
you really didn't have a very traditional wedding , did you ?
i got married in the registry office with just two friends there as witnesses . but then we had three parties to celebrate .
well , since my husband and i are from two different countries , and we live in a third country , we decided to have one in each country . it wasn't really that expensive .
i would have liked them to be there , but they couldn't afford to fly out to see us , and we couldn't
my husband's parents flew out to meet my family when we got married in my hometown , so that was great . some people spend ridiculous amounts of money on extravagant wedding receptions , but we agreed that the party should be less about money and more about family .
we waited until our one-year anniversary to go on our honeymoon to africa .
not at all , but i don't have a very traditional marriage either , so it suited us perfectly !
excuse me , may i help you , please ?
i think i'll go .

i've been to california .
no . i went to california .
could you tell me how to get to the office ?
he ' s not very good at the long jump though , is he .
two meters ? that means that the high jump bar is above his head . are any of them good at long-distance running ?
how are they at swimming ?
kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .
i think that these kinds haven ' t learnt to be afraid yet . she started diving from a lower height , but her soon wanted to go higher .
i'm very pleased with their performance . timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . that ' s very fast for a kid his age .
he ' s not bad . i can jump a distance of over four meters . i think he just prefers running to jumping . jimmy ' s very good at the high jump . he can jump over two meters . again ,
the shortest race we run is the 1500 meters . a few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
they ' re ok . i ask them to swim 500 meters each day . that ' s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . they ' re not very fast , but that ' , i just want them
i ' d be afraid to jump from the height !
it seems that they really enjoy to go faster , higher and further .
good morning . may i help you , sir ?
good for you ! it sounds like you've done a lot of planning in a very short time .
is everything ready now ?
have you tried the peninsula palace beijing ? my wedding reception was held there and them did an excellent job .
it's an excellent hotel . an friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive .
i guess you's right . i can help you ask other hotels . i am sure there are probably some available .
really going to miss .
yes , it is . we've been dating for over 7 years . we have decided to get married on a special day and we think august 8th , 2008 is a red-letter day .
yes , there is a lot of to be taken care of---wedding photos , wedding dress , catering , transport . hotel , etc ...
almost . the only thing that isn't ready is the hotel . as a lot of people have chosen that day to get married , it is hard to find a hotel that doesn't too expensive .
yes , we called , but it is booked up . the only choice is the regent beijing but i haven't made up our minds yet .
that's why we want to have a look at other hotels . we don't want to spend too much on an extravagant wedding reception .
that's very kind of you .
can you tell me how to get to the office ?
but you should have told me i were in love with her .

that's a good idea .
well , i'm not sure .
can you tell me how to get to the university ?
well , at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon . this is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth . in any case .
that just stands for greenwich mean time . here in california , we are in pacific standard time , that is eight time zones west of greenwich . remember when we were in beijing ?
what ? why do we have to make that ?
i see . that ' s convenient ! i never understood things like this , such as gmt . i never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock !
that ' s why it was so weird traveling from beijing to la ! because of the huge time difference , even though we left beijing at noon and flew for more than eight hours , we still arrived in la the same day

yes , i would love to . it's interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good .
sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours . who films do you think will win awards this year ?

yes , table etiquette . there are a multitude of rules that foreigners might never know until they were told . some practices even appear somewhat awkward or rude to westerners , while they are the norm in ch
maybe you should have placed them horizontally over your bowl or plate . they resemble two incense sticks used at sacrifices . it's very inauspicious , and might enrage all present .
sure . beijingers were distinguished for their warmth and hospitality .
to begin with , you have to use chopsticks .

i agree with you .

there was plenty of room for me to pull out . i didn't have to stay in the lane you were in .
i didn't know you were in .

i have a cell phone in my car . now it's probably on the floor on the passenger side . why don't you get it for me . and then i can call the

hey , listen . i had every right to stay in the lane i was in . you were supposed to wait until i passed to pull out . and anyhow , you didn't give me any time to change lanes . all of a sudden--bang .
sorry about your arm , but it serves you right . i need to learn how to drive . you're lucky you didn't get killed . and i'm lucky to be alive too .
fine with me . i know the laws of the road . i're not worried .
alright . i know .
oh , yeah ? it's better if i make a police report first . then you can go to the hospital .
well , you'll just have to wait . i'm not going to move my car until the police arrive . i'll go into one of those houses over there and use their phone . don't worry . you'll get
yes , maybe it does . but if you're going to drive like you did just now , you will have to get used to a little physical pain . i know what i mean ?
i'm afraid it wasn't . and when the police get here , you will also see . i'm going to go find a phone . don't move that arm while i'm gone .
could you tell me how to get to the office ?
i don't know . i haven't seen them .
don't worry . i'll go with you .

good morning . can i help you ?
my mother's been ill and i had to stay athome .

i'm sorry . i don't know .
i will teach you how to keep her .
don't worry . i'll be there .
excuse me , may i help you , sir ?
what's the problem , ?
i don't know what to do for her .
yeah , i can't see that happening . i know you're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen .
my mother-in-law used to do the same thing to us . if it wasn't disciplining them enough , then we were discipling them too much . she also complained about the food we fed them , the schools we sent them too , and everything else under
not much , except that my mother-inlaw is driving me up the wall .
she loves to nit-pick and criticizes everything that i do . i can never do anything right when she is around .
well , last week i invited her over to dinner . my husband and i had no problem with the food , but if you listened to her , then it would seems like i fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . there's just nothing can please her .
it's not just that . she also criticizes how we raise the kids .
can you tell me how to get to the supermarket ?

me , too .
yeah , there're so many excellent candidates out there . who knows whom one will make it to the final ?
he really did a great job in the finale , especially in the pk round . he performed so well . the majority of the audience cast their votes for him .
oh , i love him too . he not only sings well but shows perseverance when he encounters difficulties in the contest .
he had barely survived the second audition and finally got a chance to advance in the contest . fortunately , in the third audition , he has won popularity among the audience . and that's when i started to notice
oh , i love him .
absolutely . that's why when he entered the final , i was so excited .
and the host announced that she won it all !
may i help you , please ?
i thought i were supposed to meet here .
i ' m afraid . we must have misunderstood each other .
you ' re right . i am sorry . let ' s go and watch the movies .
hi . gary , what happened ? i was waiting for you at the theater . why didn ' t you meet me there ?
don ' t you know our movie starts at seven ? and we were going to meet at the theater at seven . then it doesn ' t make sense to meeting at the apartment .
why don ' t you try to be clearer about you intentions ?
it ' s okay . i don ' t want to go now . we ' ve already missed ten minutes of the movie . i ' d want to see a movie without watching the beginning .

the bible says that jesus christ was resurrected three days after him was crucified . people commemorate that at a festival called easter .
you're right . in china , round ' is an auspicious word . the moon cakes are in round shape .
where are you going ?
can you tell me where it is ?
i see . the dragon boat festival is a way to commemorate a great ancient poet .
that's a good idea . it looks so big though .
excuse me . may i help you , sir ?
yeah . all of us tried the best .
i heard your team won the match .
i'm glad to hear that .
excuse me . may i help you ?
don't worry , i'll get it .
don't worry . i'll get a refund .
i don't know what else you could do then . i think bribing them with chocolate would work ?
i suggest you use lipstick , which also accentuates yours .

that's interesting . how many do you write a blog ?
got it . are you still updating my blog ?
good for you . i know many people leave their blogs alone after the first few month .
sure i am . i've been writing for almost three years .
i got blogging when i first went to the us for my graduate strides .
at first . i'll write about my life there . like interesting things on the campus , travel stories , special english words that i come across . sometimes , i'll post my pictures on my blog so my friends and family can get
it's random . if there happen to be a lot of things going on . i may add several new entries in a week , and if i've got nothing to share , i may leave my blog untouched for weeks .
sure , since i came back from the us , i've been keeping a habit of blogging , simply to share my personal insights on any topic i like .
excuse me . may i help you ?

i don't know what to do now .
i'm putting on a new pair of shoes .
i didn't .
now what are you doing .
nasty . you'd better not rub your eyes .
do you have anything else ?
excuse me , may i help you , please ?
me too . i feel , as well .
really ? i know a great restaurant in dongcheng .
i'd like to go to the second floor .

poor man , he must be terribly fed up withit .
no one in the family expected to get a dime from him . it was quite a surprise !
i don't want to know .
hello . can i help you ?
it's too good to be true . if i were there , i would ask him if he himself was a successful man .
he told me to transfer to a more suitable course .
nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question . you know .
excuse me , may i help you , sir ?
logan ! why on earth are you hiding here ? white hat ! come on . don't tell me you're the guy ! it can't be true .

hey , isabelle ... ,
yes , i am the guy ,
let me explain ! i didn't mean to hurt you ...
can you tell me how to get to the supermarket ?
i'll make sure that management keeps you in mind for special projects in the future .
i am very sorry i can't .
i would like to have a drink .
excuse me . may i help you , sir ?
i'm sorry . i didn't know .
i think i know his name .
really ? he is so competent then .
not a great deal , i'm afraid .
she's betty . she is mr goldman ' s niece .
i think he has realized . but he is still whistling in the dark by putting up an act .
about 80 million dollars . i don't know .
if only he know it .
good morning . may i help you , sir ?
i am very sorry . can i get you another one ?
i'm sorry , i'm sorry .

good morning . may i help you , sir ?
it's on the right .
let's go .
sorry , i don't feel like playing . i have too much homework ?
not at all .
how are you doing ?
what research do you need ?
but they are just ads .
not yet . i'm not finished with my research yet .
read my fashion magazines ! how do you think i know so much about all the latest trends ?
duh ... that's the point . the people in the ads are wearing what's in . plus , there are articles on new trends .
hello , may i help you , please ?
that ' s great idea . but don ' t the tv station lose a lot of money because
well , you had more than one day ; couldn ' t you fit it in on another day ?
would you like to see it ?
that ' s a good idea . do you want a more coffee ?
do i want to watch it ?
there's a documentary on the history channel later on that i'd like to watch . i want to stay and watch it with me .
i ' d like to see it .
oh , peter . you really should go and play ball yourselfrather than watching games .
i think i am . i left the job only because it was too far .
if i remember correctly , there ' s a quiz !
let ' s see what else is onfirst .
excuse me , may i help you , please ?
oh yes , i loved it . wasn't the scene with the judge great ?
did you stop at the spring for some pictures ?
what did you think of it ?
so you must had had a busy and enjoyable day yesterday .
it was great .
well , i drove through the valley on our way there in the morning . it was a magnificent sight .
sure , we wouldn't miss that for anything . after that , we took a short cut to the park . there was very little traffic , so we get there in less than an hour .
yeah , we spent the whole day under the tall trees . we had our picnic there , too .
yes , you are right . and i was so tired out that i fell asleep on the way back . my muscles were still stiff from the swim yesterday .
can you tell me how to get to the university ?
she told me that peter and she has a quarrel last nigh , and she left last morning , bag and baggage .
what do you think ?
oh , i see . but i think you are making a mess . they will make it up . bet it .
i don't know what to do now .
for the first drive , put a golf ball on the tee , and push the tee into the ground .
i don't know what to do with it .
what ? in your cubicle !
all right . i'll take home economics .
here's the course description .
if you're sure you're not in a hurry , i can help .
i don't know what to do .
i'm not sure , you're not familiar with the city , too .
excuse me . may i help you , please ?
that's what i think .
that's not the gadgets . creating programmes is stimulating thoughts .
but i ... i don't agree with that ,because computers weaken kids ' ability to think , because kids don't learn basic skills .
i don't think computers teach kids to think .
excuse me , may i have your name ?
don ' t you think she is like your daughter ?
let ' s say about 6 .00 ?
7 o ' clock .
i ' m glad to hear .
yes , i ' m not sure .
i would like to .
i think you can say your seventh great grandfather ! cutie ! what's hisname ?
i didn't know you were coming .
i'll see you then .
where are you going ?
how long have you been working ?
i don't know what to do .
i can't believe that .
believe me . he is the first-class .
i'm going to a party .
well , my mother came from a big family , and wanted to have one of her own .
yes . you can take your glass , paper , plastic , cardboard , and tin cans to a recycling center .
i'm just pissed that management can't see behind his smooth talking lies .
i don't know what to do .
hello . can i help you , sir ?
of course i do . i love it . all the games are boring and the competitors are respectable .
yeah . what's the difference between the winter olympics and the summer olympals ?
i see . then , what's you favorite winter sport ?
then you must know shen due , hao hongbo .
you should go to talk with may , she is a big fan of them too .
of course . it's the tradition game in winter . and with good reason .
that's true . for various reasons , it takes more to hold a fierce game for winter olympics than it does for summer olympus . you know , the low temperature may cause many problems .
when the olympic games started in modern times , only summer events were included . when it grew popular , there came the winter olympo games , which includes a variety of winter sports .
figure skating . in my eyes , nothing beats it .
oh , i didn't expect you to know them , but yes , i love them not only because of many medals they've won , but also because of their spirits .
can you tell me how to get to the university ?
would you like to go with me ?
what are you going to do ?
i've heard that the environment there is very good .
i worked over the summer at a restaurant . have to make tuition money , right ?
i'd like to go to the park .
i would like to go to the beach .
really ? what did you think !
hello . may i help you , sir ?
ok , tell me when you'll order the rest of your food .
just a club soda for me .
excuse me . may i help you ?
i'll be back with you in a minute .
i'm sorry to hear about you .
no , i don't know .
can you tell me how to get to the university ?
then which ' s your first choice ?
yeah , i can find plenty of online .
that ' s a good idea .
i ' m going to go to the movies .
i ' ll make sure that my wife will be financially secure if i die .
can you tell me why you changed your major when you were a graduate student ?
well , i think it ' s the time to pull my plug .
excuse me . can i help you ?
that's a big family . how old is your brother ?
you think it is better that he should be tell ?
i see . and the quantities . ?
that'sright , sarah and jane are both your cousins although they are step-sisters .
that must have been wonderful . do something interesting ?
i hear you are going to be expecting .
oh , i didn't know that .
yes . he is coming on his own .
well , he uses our vcr at home . but he's going to university in the fall , so he has his own vcr .
i'm sure you are .
they want to travel to europe next year , and will visit us .
can you tell me how to get to the office ?
where do you spend your holiday ?
i am swapped with work after 10 - day holiday .

where did you go to school ?
how long have you lived here ?
how long did you go to school ?
when did you go to college ?
do you have any plans for the future ?
i'm from paula .
i was born in .
i was born in montreal .
yes . i went to school here .
i went to gradate school , but then i was offered a good job doing marketing , so i changed my mind .
i was in high school when i graduated .
i went to high school in america .
excuse me , may i help you ?
how do you feel about your mother ?
i think the most important thing is to be nice to others .
i think i'm polite , careful , relaxed , and shy .
it's pretty simple , iris . just keep i in mind that you're what you eat .
my husband is an american . he criticizes me when i do that . he says that i can't change a child's behavior by using force .
excuse me , sir . can i help you ?
well , i think i know what i need to say .
i agree with you , but i don ' t know what to say .
i know , but i don ' t know .
i don ' t know . if we can't ,
to be honest , i don't know what to do .
don ' t worry . that would be just a part of being a teenager .
you do need to take some medicines with you . just to case .
what kind of qualities are you looking for in a friend ?
i know , but i don ' t know who you were with .
can i help you , sir ?
where did he go to ?
he used to be a doctor .
yeah , he's a private eye now .
can you tell me how to get to the university ?
most of them are from mexico .
i don't know what to do .
i can't find it .
can i help you , mary ?
the house warming .
i'm not sure . i don't know .
oh , i don't know .
yes , i has . i went out with them last weekend .
yes , it is . there are three bedrooms , a living room , a dining room , and a big kitchen . there's also a large kitchen .
well , that did sound nice . have they moved in yet ?
when are they going to have a party ?
wow . that would be something to look forward to .
my invitation , no , i haven't .
whose house warming party are it ?
oh , they have ? i didn't know . i haven't seen tom lately .
have you seen the house ?
would you like to come ?
well , that sounds nice . have they moved in yet ?
they are moving today . tom's taken the day off . he's rented a truck , and they should have all their furniture in the house tonight .
next saturday night . i should get your invitation today or tomorrow .
excuse me . can i help you , sir ?
oh , but i really need to leave this town for a change . working day after day has worn me out . do you have any other suggestions ?
wonderful ! i think that's a great idea how soon until we can make this happen ? i can't wait !
perfect . i'ii start preparing tomorrow . if we're going to drive , l'ii need to fill up the tank .
we can take the train , that will be faster . i-ii book the tickets tomorrow morning .
no problem . i'm really looking forward to the coming weeks .
i could go for that , but i'm afraid our budget is a little tight this year .
we should probably think about going somewhere that is not too far away . how about the countryside ? there must be many interesting places , and we could enjoy the fresh air .
tomorrow i have an appointments with my dentist . what about next monday ?
not need . i think it's still plenty full . even so , i'd rather travel by bus or train . it would cost much less than driving . oil prices are soaring nowadays , you know .
great ! oh , one more thing , don't forget to check the weather before we go . i'd hate to get caught in the rain .
me , too . now let's make a list for what we need to with us .
excuse me . can i help you ?
you know . i really must be going now or i'll be very late . can you give me a call tomorrow an we'll decide ?
no , is it difficult to get a girlfriend ?
why do you ask me these questions .

don't worry . i'm right back .
i must catch the nine thirty train .
ok . i'll meet you .
all right . i'll have a drink .

back to live with my parents . that's something else i used to doing before we were married . remember ?
could you tell me how to get to the office ?
i love it ! i used to always want to drive a green jaguar .
i've seen photos of ufos in america before , but they ' ve all looked doctored up .
i don't think i like it .
i see what you mean , i think that's way i like it so much .
not really . i don't think i have much depth .
so , how did you become interested in it ?
yes , i am .
i know about that . but i do think that it helps people relax .
yes , it's my favorite .
what kind of music do i prefer then ?
that's why i like it .
i've always been into it . have i always liked classical music ?

is it ? i've never thought of any disadvantages of the Mobile phone .
that's true . some people pay too much attention to their mobile phone .
it bear a great many of advantages , but also some weak points .
for instance , the mobile phone seriously distracts the attention of people from work and study .
actually , it's not the fault of the mobile phone . but people should have a proper attitude towards it . mobile phone is a tool serving people , not the fetters restricting them .

you've really hot . let me get you some tylenol to bring the fever down .
zach , what's that on your arms ?

i completely forgot about my cat allergy . i took care of a cat for my friend here a few days ago . oh no . we'd better go to the doctor to get some medicine . let's go .
we will , but let's just go and see if there's an opening now before it gets worse .
i won't do that . i have an important meeting to go to today .
not really . after a 12 - hour flight , i've got jetlag , and on top of that , i think i've also got the flu .
would you feel my forehead and check to see if i have a fever ?
ok . i'll stay home this morning and rest , but if i feel better in the afternoon , i're going to the meeting .
i don't know . it looks a bit red , but i'm sure it'm nothing .
just cats , but i don't think i were near any cats in the last couple of weeks .
shouldn't we make a appointment first ?
whatever you say . i just want to get to my meeting .
good morning . may i help you ?
i can't go .
may i help you , sir ?

i can give them some medicine .
hello , can i help you ?
not yet . i ' ll cook dinner and have it ready by the time .
i don't know what to do .
would you like to read ?
how about winter ?
how about spring ?
but sometimes summer is more charming than the other seasons .
we're better go out for a walk .
i don't like spring .
i like it most .
well , i don't like summer .

hello . can i help you , sir ?
do you know who will get it ?
yes , i think he will .
well , i think he'll win .
good morning . can i help you , sir ?
you know . in a sense , a suits and ties are compulsory for male employees even in july , and no jewelry allowed for most of the female employees . even the reasonable male leaf is returning the rule , isn ' t that strict ?
but it is unjust to judge a book by its cover . if they ' re not happy or comfortable with their clothes , they can be less productive .
well , i was wondering where those people with professional attire came from . now , i know the answer .
to some extent , it is . anyway , whether they like it or not , they do giving people a very good impression .
excuse me . can i help you ?
i didn't know he won .
i didn't think he was going to win .
how do you know that i didn't try ? i just couldn't manageit .
i'm sorry . i didn't know that .
i don't think he's going to win .
i don't think so .
i thought he was going to win .
i thought he won the gold .
i think he was using a lot of drugs .
i didn't know that .
i don't think he should have won .
i don't think so . i think it's unfair .
can you tell me how to get to the supermarket ?
why do you say that ?
i think the most important thing is that all the shows are about the same .
that's cool . i've heardLa has an all-asian channel on cable .
no , i don't like them .
in taiwan , a sitcom is about ordinary people .
can i help you , sir ?
i love history , but i ' ve always thought that learning the reasons behind events is more important than remembering exactly when they happened .
some people say that history repeat itself .
the idea is that the people and dates change , but the reasons why things happen stay the same .
yes , i am . i enjoyed studying it at school , though i had trouble remembering all the dates , so my teacher never give me good marks .
i wish you had been my history teacher . i might have got better marks !
what does that mean ? the same events never happen twice , do they ?
i see . i think i ' d agree with that statement . people often seem to make the same mistake over and over again .
good afternoon . may i help you ?
thank you very much .
good morning . may i help you , sir ?
well , if i were you , i should go on studying .
you can't be serious . it's very hard .
how he manages to do that is always a mystery .
i see . are the seats available ?
i think i've caught a cold . now i was aching all over .
i'm not sure . i don't know what to do .
if you take a 75 % position in the venture , i would take a back seat to you .
no , she didn't . after half an hour she stopped watching and started to read a book .
i appreciate the offer . i will come on time next monday . see .
excuse me . may i help you , sir ?
oh , that's right .
yes . i ' m . c .
excuse me , sir . can i help you ?
but i don ' t envy those who are filthy with dough . that ' s not the whole life .
you ' re right . i think we should win a lot of medals .
i ' m sure we ' ll win a lot .
well , let me see . now it ' s 11:00 sharp . there ' s a long way to go . if i take the shortest route , we may come across a traffic jam .
that's great . i can't believe it .
the lakers . jordan is the only good player washedton has .
a chance ? not just a chance , i ' re a hundred percent certain . everyone says my voice is beautiful .
i suppose so . it ' s really good .
excuse me . can i help you , sir ?
well , drop by if you could .
no , just bring herself . i hope to see you there .
i may have something on that day , but thanks for inviting me .
i will , do you want me to bring any ?
hello . can i help you ?
poor guy ! it willtake him a long time to get back on his feet .
what exactly is wrong with this ?
it's unbelievable . he used to be such a rough guys .
good afternoon . may i help you ?
it must be fun . but you know , i am not good at chess . i never won .
i don't know how to play chess .
i shared a prize with some friends last week . we won .
i'd like to play chess .
ok , i'll teach you .
yes , i know .
i won a prize last month . perhaps next time , i'll be luckier and win the jackpot !
can you tell me how to get to the supermarket ?
do you know chinese more now ?
oh , yeah . many chinese like to bargain , it happens almost everywhere .
a shouting match . you ' re so funny . you must be exaggerating . i don't believe it .
yes , perhaps . chinese usually don ' t notice that sort of thing . maybe it ' s quite natural to me .
i have been here for about three months .
oh , definitely . i remember , when i first arrived in guangzhou , my girlfriend was .
oh , i mean , i understand that . but the speed of the conversation got faster and faster , until it seemed to me that they would fight . my perception of the tone was that it was a violent shouting match . the truth was that
i am not exaggerating at all . i ' m telling you a truth . that was how i felt at that time .
yes ,absolutely true .
can you tell me how to get to the supermarket ?
when did you read the first book ?
i don't know .

well ... the garbage disposal doesn't work , we have rats , and the toilet is backed up .
how did he know that he had bad .
it seems that folks like my father and your grandmother are determined to be on their own .
i don't know what to do now .
i think someone are stalking me .
i don't know . i see him the first time tuesday . he was at the cafe . i noticed he was looking at me a lot . not just the usual looking , but staring . he just kept staring at
i didn't do anything . finally , he left . but then i saw him again today . outside the shoe store . near the cafe . i went into a cd store and pretended i was looking at cd's .
yes . then i noticed he was on a sidewalk behind me . he was following me .

i am going to be married in the spring .

even the roller coasters that go through tunnels !
thanks for the advice . i've talk to my fiance about it tonight .
no , i haven't .
that's right . why do i ask ?
how long have you been ?
congratulations ! i have no idea
i don't think i'd like to .
if you don't think twice about the rides and go on every ride that you can , you'll have a good time .
even those , it'll be very romantic , i think . you'll have loads of fun .
i'm sure him'll love the idea . just throw yourself into it and you'll enjoy it !

he was killed in a car accident .

i really need to get some things before ileave .

i don't really feel like an walk .
would you like to go with me ?

i want to go to the supermarket .
the library closes at seven o'clock .

may i help you ?
saint jude- he's the saint of lost causes . like my cousin , anna , who can't stop getting pregnant .
excuse me . can i help you ?
he borrow some money from me and i needed it back . he said he didn ' t have the money yet .
yeah , but is got angry with him too quickly . he probably thought that i mistrusted him . i shouldn ' t have got angry .
not much . i had to pay an unexpected bill . so i needed the money back .
no , we didn ' t . i guess you ' re right . we should patch things up .
what did you argue about ?
well , he should pay you back . it ' s all fair .
did you lend he a lot of money ?
well , talk to him about it next time you see him . he probably feels as bad about it as you do . close friends sometimes have disagreements . it ' s nothing unusual . neither of you said anything ,
of course you should . i wouldn ' t want a silly argument to ruin a long friendship , would you ?
excuse me , sir . can i help you ?
maybe so . but a law banning cigarettes would do no good .
i don't think so . i think the government should do everything it can to discourage people from smoking .
no . you can't suddenly make smoking illegal . but the government could prohibit smoking in public places , cinemas and theaters .
excuse me , may i help you , please ?
i don't know .
i don't know what to say .
i know . but this year i want to get her an interesting tie . like this one .
yes , they are .
i think so .

i did wish i could lose weight .
i've tried diets before . they've never worked .

can you tell me how to use the internet ?
it was a great trip .
excuse me , sir . can i help you ?
i've been working here for five years .
yes , sometimes . i don't like working nights i have problems sleeping during a day .
to be frank , not very much , because i can't use much what i've learned in my work . i enjoy doing more challenging work .
good . do i know anything about this company ?
yes . i'm looking forward to meeting everybody and getting started on my new job .
how long have you been with the company ?
where do you work ?
i know what you mean , but i'd rather be cold than hot .
i'm sure i will .

can you tell me what it is ?

can you tell me how to get to the office ?
but you should have informed me you were in love with her .
i didn't know you were in love .
yes , but you might have told i before .
you can't be serious . how dare you not tell me i are going to marry her ?
oh , you men ! we are all the same .

hello , can i help you , sir ?
i ' m going to the airport .
well , first of all . i like to pamper myself , and my nails look great . you should come with me !
they don ' t only paint my nails ! the manicurist will remove my cuticles , file my nails , and apply at least nail coats
where are you going now ?

good morning . may i help you , sir ?
i'm very well , thank you . how is you ?

that ' s exactly what i am going to do . i ' ve decided to create my own company ! i ' m going to write up a business plan , get some investors and start working for myself !
well , no . it can ' t be that hard ! i mean , all you have to do is explain your business , how you are going to do things and that ' s it , right ?
well , that seems easy enough . ?
geez . is that all ? .
umm . i think i ' ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !
so what are you gonna do ? i just quit ?
have you ever written up a business plan before ?
you couldn ' t be more wrong ! a well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has , history . etc .
wait , there ' s more ! then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . what they are and how they are different from competitors ' ? then comes the hard part , a market analysis .
almost , the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . here you will calculate and estimate sales , cash flow and profits . after all , people will want to know when they will begin to see

yeah that would be cool ! maybe i can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! and what about a flame thrower !
wow , i didn ' t know ! it always looks so cool and easy in the movies .
let ' s do it !
not much , just heading over to the shooting range . you wanna come .
yeah , it will be fun ! i have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . i also have a revolver that ' s really fun too ! they have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve .
whoa , take it easy there rambo . don ' t get carried away . these weapons are not toys , and you must first learn how to handle them properly . there are basic rules that you must abide by
the reality is different you know , running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! so are i ready ?

i ' m in new york for a wedding .

come on ? nothing can be that bad .
ok , i promise . so what're troubling you so much ?

then what's your problem ? ...
oh , i see , office romance tends to be the subject of gossip .
office romance is very tricky . ...
cheer up , nada . you'd be fine .
i don't know . my life was a big mess . everything is so complicated .
but promise me , you'll keeping it a secret .
i've fallen in love with my manager .
i'm afraid not . he is still single .
i tried to keep it to myself . but there is a lot of gossip about us .
worse still , he are trying to avoid me these days .
it gives me a lot of pressure and i feels depressed .
hello . may i help you , sir ?
with the job ?
a good suggestion for you . you want a holiday .
it wasn't always like this ?
you need an holiday . that's what's the matter .
oh . nothing special . i'm just a bit tired .
with all , with everybody , with all this !
it isn't always like this , you know .
i was very sad when i was laying off last year .
certainly , perhaps .
excuse me , can i help you , sir ?
logan ! why on earth are you hiding here ? white hat ! come on . don't tell me you're the guy ! it can't be true .
what a bummer ! you set me up .
i didn't mean to hurt you .
what did you lie to me in the email ?
i should have known it was you . no wonder all the 20 questions were answered correctly . i think i might have found the one for me .
hey , isabelle ... ?
yes , i is the guy .
i didn't mean to hurt you .
hang on a second . hear me out , just this once , isabella !
i didn't lie . you just didn't ask me my real name .
i'm sorry . it was cruel of me . but i promise it will never happen again . look , there's a nice restaurant . let me take you to dinner and we can talk things over .
can i help you , sir ?
what do you do ?
what kind of food do you like ?
what do you eat ?
i don't drink tea .
i exercise four times a day .
i eat a lot of fruit and vegetables .
i don't eat a lot .
i drink a lot of juice .
hello , may i help you , sir ?
did you go ?
did you watch the final ?
do you know who won ?
yes , i watched united play chelsea . what a fierce battle ! allay were engaged in intensive pressing and tackling in midfield . well , it was not like a normal english league match
they didn't win .
they managed a 99 :80 victory .
excuse me , may i have a seat ?
you've never been in a gay bar , did you ?
i don't think so . i think the most important thing is what you wear to work .
what kind of dress would you wear to work ?
i don't agree with that .
how do you know that ? you haven't got in yet !
where are you going ?
i don't know what to tell you .
that's quite famous but don't you think it looks a bit old-fashioned ?
what other important buildings are we going to see on 5 avenue ?
what's there after that ? ?
what are all their for ?
i don't think so .
yes , look over here . that's the empire state building . my book says it's 102 stories tall .
you're right , but when it was built in 1930 it was a marvel of technology and engineering .
quite a number . actually every skyscraper has a history . a few blocks ahead we'll see st . patrick , s cathedral and just across the street will be the world-renowed rockefeller center . it's a landmark
well then , there's a central park . facing the park on fifth avenue are probably some of the most expensive properties in the world .
most of them are office buildings , huge department stores , and hotels but some are just private homes . new york is one of the financial centers of the words so there are lots of very expensive places .
excuse me . can i help you , sir ?
i didn't know you were a twin !are you identical or fraternal ?
i hear her boyfriend is married .
i don't know what to do .
after going through an episode , i'm not surprised . how's her headspace ?
and just one more question . would you like to be an interpreter ?
i was very sad when i was laying off last year .
i don't know . i'm just shopping .
she said she was going to be out of college .
yes , my parents did .
well , i was only there for three days , so we didn't do too much . we went shopping and went out to dinner a few times . and at night we walked around the city with some friends .
nearly ten years . and your parents took it seriously .
you won't do it until tomorrow .
i'll say , i am really stacked , isn't she ?
can you tell me how to get to the supermarket ?
i think so . yes , they get along so well .
you're right . he sure is .
yes , i ' m sure .
i like him . he's good for her .
hello . may i help you ?
why do you think that ?
well , honestly speaking , i went to watch it out of curiosity .
i know what he wants to do . does he want help me or just scold me ?
excuse me . can i help you ?
i don't think so .
oh , i see . i'm sorry .
excuse me , sir . can i help you ?
i suppose her's right . does she speak english very slowly ?
it must be interesting to study english . .
is english pronunciation easy or difficult ? ?
oh , we never spoke spanish in class ! miss . parker speaks to us only in english .
not always . sometimes we don't understand her . then she has to repeat what she said .
mario and i are the best students in the class . miss parkers says that my pronunciation is very good .
sometimes it's difficult . some words look different from the way that one pronounces them .
excuse me . may i help you ?
i don't like winter .
seeking plum blossoms with stepping on the snow , that's a good idea .
take care ! don't slip down to the ground .
yes . very wonderful .
it's so beautiful !
yes , it is .
i don't know what to say .
i'll call you saturday !
i've got it . i like the sound of stepping on the snow very much .

excuse me . can i help you ?
i don't know what to do with him .
how are you doing ?
oh , i see .
oh , i see !
wow ! michael jordan ' s slam-dunks are beautiful things to watch .
which team do you think will won ?
kobi bryanant and shaquille o ' neal , they are the los angeles lakers ' star players .
wait a second . he shoots , he score !
all right , now .
yeah . he ' s older , so he doesn ' t slam , as much as he did when he was younger . but when he does , it ' s still amazing .
the lakers . jordan is the only good player washton has .
good morning . may i help you , sir ?
first of all , i need you to do the drying up .
i already have some medicine at home if i could just get there .
i will go to the bank , give them my check , show them one piece of my identifications , and the most important thing is that i know who i am .

i can't afford to buy more .
i have a good solution ... we need some new blood . we should get rid of this president and boat in some new leaders !
yes , the government has taken some measures to curb the increase .
then let's split the difference and i can give you 60 yuan , ok ?

i can hardly make ends make these days .
my income remains the same but prices just continue to rise .

i don't know what to do .
i don't know what to do about it .
good morning . can i help you , sir ?
you shouldn't grab someone else's shirt .
i'm sorry . i didn't know .
i am completely satisfied with the terms of this contract .
it was scary at first . after awhile , i got used to it . if you have fast reflexes , then it's not really a problem . what position did you play ?
well , let's play .
can you tell me how to get to the bank ?
what do you do ?
what's that ?
that makes you feel uncomfortable ? .
perhaps that's because we hold different ideas about privacy .
oh , that's not rare . i've seen people reading at others ' newspaper while taking a metro or a bus .
yeah . it's not rare .
yeah , almost . and there is one thing .
i got married in china .
there's no privacy in china .
yeah , we never do that in a public office .
i have felt that . one day when i was in a queues , reading a newspaper story , the man behind me peered through my shoulder and stared at the newspaper i was holding .
just stare at the newspaper holding in the hands of the one next to him ?
