in that case , you should prepare for the interview by telling the interviewer what you want to talk about .

thank you , mr . johnson . i ' m looking forward to seeing you .
that ' s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! the government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low cost of import . they ' ve also reduced the cost of production by 50 % .
un unique , aren ' t they ? i bet you ' ve never tasted anything like it ! quality is guaranteed as i personally contact the factory to make sure no one ' s cutting corners with the ingredients .
i ' m sorry , mr . johnson , but this traditional kind of chocolate has been handed down in the granger family for generations . i ' m sure you can keep it in the family .
well , it ' s a traditional scottish delicacy , i ' ve never tasted this kind of delicately prepared food before and i don ' t know why .
thank you , mr . johnson . i look forward to seeing you tomorrow .
no problem . if possible i always combine business with pleasure . now , let ' s hear more about these china tours you ' re providing !

very good . mmm , hmm . creamy texture , very smooth ... ?
well , very interesting , very unusual , very unique , that ' s for sure . exactly what are they ?
that ' s very kind of you , mr . johnson .
well , that ' s just the horses and donkeys that are in the stable here .
may i help you ?

how long does the tour take ?
what can i do for you ?
what can i do for you ?
yes , that's right .
oh , taylor . nice to meet you too .
excuse me , could you tell me how to get to the grand hotel ?
i think that we can handle it by myself .
i see . if i got hurt when repairing the light , especially during office hours , i wouldn ' t get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility .
thank you , like this one .
monica , wait a second . i think we ' d better call the repair man to do it .
i ' d like you to have a look at the safety manual for our company .
other company rules also need to exist .

i don't want to hear it , dave .
what's wrong ?
why don't you join webtracker ? it's fun .
i don't want to talk to you about it . vince is my brother .
what are you doing ?
why don't you just get one ?
why don't you just get a bus pass ?
you don't have to pay for it .
if you buy one , you can save money .
you should get a bus pass , too .
i don't know where to get it .
i'm not going to buy one .
how much do i have to pay ?
i didn't think of that .
that's a good idea .
that's a good idea .
good morning . what can i do for you ?

how many kinds of dishes do you usually make ?
do you find it hard to find ingredients for the dishes ?
how long does it take you to cook a meal ?

you could ask for help . i usually insist on doing the washing up . i just don ' t like doing them .
i don ' t mind doing it . i ' ve only recently started cooking chinese food . i need some more practice .
not at all . you can find most of the ingredients at supermarket . the ingredients are usually the same as in western food . the way that the food is prepared is also the point .

well , a home inspection is a home inspector who inspects for problems that might not be apparent to you .
the owners told me that the roof had leaked , and that the walls had leaked .
the sellers didn ' t tell me anything about the problems before the inspection .
i found some problems with the roof , walls , and even the toilet .

there are a lot of options . you could ask her over dinner , or ask her in a public area .

well , they had enough harvests for the next winter and agreed to have a big feast for the whole year .
sure . you look like you're all greener and blue .
oh , that ' d be all right .
i deal with people who are honest , dedicated to their work and who have integrity .
well , the most important thing in a person is that they are honest and fun .
i reminded her that you can do anything that you want to do .
generally speaking , i ' m more interested in getting feedback of my colleagues .
working under pressure is exciting and challenging . i don ' t mind . in fact , i am very efficient when certain people are exerted on the employees .
it's kind of simple , i think . just keep it to yourself that you're what you eat .
at that time her back was ramrod straight as she sailed , her tone is best , neither over-passionate nor over-confident .
excuse me , could you tell me where the post office is ?
i don't want to hear bean say something like that again .
i don't think so . it's just a waste of time and money .

that sounds like a good idea . do you want to try some other food ?
excuse me , could you tell me where the post office is ?
what kind of lectures do we have to give ?
yeah , well , i can fill you in the details later .
honestly speaking , it is the most exciting thing for me . i love the flexible hours of this company .
what is that ?
what kind of tests do they need ?
good morning , sir . may i help you ?
well , may i ask what the occasion is ?
i see . this arrangement looks very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends .
we have a dozen dozen red roses and a bear that stands out from the rest .
i ' m sorry sir , we don ' t have any in stock . what do you think ?
i ' m sorry sir , we can ' t do that here . we have a variety of flower arrangement . you can choose from the flower arrangement , the red roses , the tulips , the sunflowers and the orchid .

what do you think of the new television channel ?
so , if the cause is a poverty , there should be a means to make the country richer . if the problem is resources , share them .
yes , it is . one way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . wars are very common .
i don't think so . the united nations could use peace and quiet .
it sounds easy when you say it like that . in reality , it's harder to make ends meet .
excuse me , miss . may i have your name please ?
what are you doing over here ?
that ' s all right . bring them over what i ' ve got done .
yes . after so many years of hard work , i think i had an office of my own .

i'd like to work in a publishing house or something .
i don't think that's a good idea .
excuse me . is this the way to the railway station ?
i agree with you , but i think it's getting worse and worse .
i think that's the problem .
i don't think it's time for them to turn over a new leaf .
i don't know what to tell them .
i don't think they are serious about doing this .
i agree with you . but we have to work hard to make things better .
i agree with you , but it's getting a little tiresome these days .
excuse me . is this the way to the railway station ?
no problem . just a moment , please . i'll do that .
sure . i'll call you later .
ok . i'll wait for you .

what do you think is the most important thing for a new employee to do ?
yes , so long as they listen to what the staff say .
the flexible hours and flexible hours have been a big attraction for me . i love working with people .
i took a survey of the new employees to find out what they think is the most important thing for them .

welcome to our bank . what can i do for you ?
i don't think so . i think it's best to keep a relaxed tone .
i see . then , what else can i do ?
you're right . in a sense , it's best to keep a low profile , if you don't know what you are doing .
i see . what else can we do ?
i think the most important thing is to keep your spirits up .
i agree with you , but i don't think it's important to keep a low profile .
in other words , it's best to keep a low profile .
i agree with you , but don't overdo it . just keep it chin up .
excuse me , sir . could you tell me where the scholar cinema is ?
we usually don't have that many in stock , but we do have a few in stock . do you want to order some ?
well , as a rule , all the new cartridges need to be delivered before the end of the month . if they are not delivered before october , we will have to wait until after october .
i'm afraid we're running out of ink right now . will you be able to wait for the rest of the cartridges ?
let me key in your information on your computer . i will pull up your records and give you an exact order . what is the exact order you want ?
that's really unbearable ... i don't think we will be able to handle that .
good morning , sir . can i help you ?
i want a pair of size 41 .
oh , i like it very much . how much is it ?
what size do you wear ?
how about this pair ? they're very fashionable .
good morning . may i help you ?

well , first of all , he recommended me to subscribe to it .
what is the most important thing for you to do when starting a career ?
i think it is good if we know enough about career planning . we can make wiser decision later . what else do you need ?
that sounds good . i will subscribe to it .
well , then , you can subscribe to it . you can also get more benefits from it .
excuse me , where is the post office ?
ok . i'll go and open it .
it's for you , mum .
welcome to our bank . what can i do for you ?
how many of you are coming ?
how many people are there in your family ?
no , i don't .
two , please .
good morning , sir . what can i do for you ?
are you saying that all the test results were in ?
will i be able to see the results at the computer ?
how will i know what the results mean ?
can i see all of the test results in one day ?
i didn ' t see anything out of the ordinary , but i need to log onto your website for more information .
if there were any problems with the test results , you should call us .
yes , you will be able to see the results in person .
you can see all of the test results and compare them .
you can see all of the test results for free on the website .
excuse me , where is the nearest bank ?
i don't think we'll be able to come down this price . the gap is too great .
i don't think we can meet each other halfway .
i'm afraid we can't make any further concessions , mr . lee .
i'm afraid we can't meet each other halfway . the gap is too great .
i'm afraid we can't meet each other halfway .
this is our rock-bottom price .
i don't think it's possible for us to make a reduction of 10 % .
we should meet each other halfway , so that we can work out a deal .
i'm afraid i can't agree with you on that . the gap is too great .
i don't think that's the best we can do . we can't meet each other half way .
good morning . may i help you ?
yes . what time would you like me to get you ?
yes , we are supposed to meet at the chinatown terminal .
yes , that's right .
that's right .
yes , carl . see you tomorrow .
hello . is there anything i can do for you ?
let me see . i'm supposed to invite you to a dinner tonight .
oh , i see . where should we meet ?
oh , i see . when do we meet ?
ok , i got it . bye .
yes , carl .
what do you think of the new television channel ?
what kind of regulations have you introduced ?
do you have any problems with the quality of your products ?
not really . we have been affected by a series of tax evictions .
we use a lot of raw materials to make our products . we don't use any other materials . we import from other countries .
if we fail to meet the regulations , we'll have to pay a fine .
may i help you ?
i hope you like it .
no , i'm feeling a little under the weather .
thanks . i appreciate it .
excuse me , sir . may i help you ?
of course , sir . we'll be there in a moment .
yes , of course . i'm on my way now .
excuse me , could you tell me how to get to the forbidden city ?
what are the other factors ?
i think the most important factor is the quality of the goods sold . most goods are environmentally-friendly .
i think the most important factor is the quality of the products . some of the environmentally-friendly items are very expensive .
excuse me , sir . may i help you ?
well , he says ' mommy , daddy , mommy ' and ' daddy ' all the time .
yes , i think so . but sometimes he is not reasonable .
i ' m afraid you can ' t say that . he is a naughty boy .
i ' ll try my best to prevent him from doing these things .
what words ? is that spanish ?
honey , i don ' t know what to tell you . he ' s a young boy and he needs to learn new things .
i suggest that you treat him with gentleness , respect , and respect .
don ' t underestimate his ability to learn and reason . he says a lot of bad words in front of us .
what can i do for you ?
do you have an appointment , mr . mason ?
i'm afraid mr . mason can't come until 2 o'clock . he is not expected back until 4 . let me see if he can make it .
thank you very much . mr . mason . i look forward to seeing you .
i am very sorry , mr . mason . we will make arrangements for someone else to meet with you at 4 pm .
i would like to buy a skirt .
yes , he is coming to see me this afternoon .
no , thank you .
thank you . that would be very nice .
what can i do for you ?
did they go to the oscars ?
they are also the richest couples in the world . they have so much money that they can buy almost anything they want .
did either one of them win an oscar this year ?
tom cruise may be handsome , but i think he's a bit eccentric .
i heard that they got married to get more publicity for their films .
i didn't want to be a celebrity , because the paparazzi could also be after you .
i guess we're not rich and famous either .
no , i didn't .
they must be the most famous celebrity couple in hollywood !
i also heard that tom richards and kate milliken made an appearance at the oscars .
i think tom cruise might have been nominated for one of his films , but i don't think he won any .
yeah , his marriage to katie is actually quite scandalous .
people in the entertainment industry have such an easy life ; i don't know why they have to spend so much money .
that's true . i guess it would be difficult to have people taking pictures of you wherever you go .
i know about that , but i wouldn't mind being rich and famous again .
excuse me , could you tell me where the post office is ?
of course . how much would you like to purchase ?
how much would you like to purchase ?
could you fill out this form , please ?
ok , please fill out this exchange form .
ok , here you are .
thank you very much .
what can i do for you ?
i see . how much do i need to pay ?
i would like to exchange 1,000 usd into rib .
in 100 rib , please .
ok , here you are .
ok , here you are .
ok , thanks a lot .
excuse me , sir . what can i do for you ?
it's my duty to keep all prisoners in check .
good morning , sir . what can i do for you ?
well , i prefer to go on the train , so i suppose you want me to take the car .
and i've got to drive . you know i'm not fond of that . i found it so much more relaxing to sit in a car .
but very much quicker . but i know we always agree on this subject . you prefer the cars . i prefer the train .
that would be nice . how are you getting along in there ?
oh , i really like to go by car , then we don't need to get to the station with our luggage and ...
which is even more expensive ?
now . have you ever thought about going by express bus ?
excuse me , could you tell me how to get to the railway station ?
yes , we have it listed on our list .
let ' s go check out the kitchen . it looks like a small cottage .
i would love to take a look at the kitchen .
what is the asking price for this house ?
how long have you lived in this house ?
would you like to see that house ?
i would like to look at the kitchen . it is very small .
look at the flyer with all the information about the home on it .
the listing agent will take a look at the house and let you know when the house is available .
good morning , sir . what can i do for you ?
well , first of all , i'd like to have a compact car .
i'm afraid i've got the wrong number , mrs . wilson . may i have your name please ?
well , it's 30 dollars and 95 cents a mile .
thank you very much .
certainly , sir . what model do you want ?
you see , madam . you've got a new car , right ?
yes , it's in the second floor .
all right , madam . can i take a look ?
certainly . how much is this ?
excuse me , could you tell me how to get to the railway station ?
i don't know . what's playing ?
don't you think it's too bloody ?
that's great . what's on ?
i like romantic movies . i like thrillers best .
i don't think it's very exciting .
good evening , sir . can i help you ?
i scheduled it on monday .
i scheduled it for monday .
i would like to come in on monday .
i would like to come in at 6
well , what day is your appointment ?
what time would you like it ?
what time would you like it to be ?
what time would you like it to be ?
that would be fine . see you then .
excuse me , sir . can i help you ?
i am sorry , janet , but our order has been rejected .
hello , mr . robert . i'd like to book a room with a bath .
well , the fax machine in my office isn ' t working properly . i need help with it .
welcome to our company . how can i help you ?
it's been a pleasure meeting you , ms anderson .
thank you , mike . nice to meet you .
thank you , they are very lovely .
good morning . what can i do for you ?
how much is it ?
i can't believe that .
that's too expensive .
i can't go down that price .
it's only $ 2500 .
that's great . how much does it cost ?
this tv is only $ 1050 .
how much is this t . v . ?
this is a very good television .
how about this one ?
is that the lowest price you can go ?
excuse me , could you tell me how to get to the central railway station ?
what are you going to do with it ?
how much do you need to pay for it ?
what are you going to take with you ?
how many cigarettes do you bring in every day ?
i ' m sorry sir . we ' re going to have to confiscate this bag .
yes , i have . i left it in my bag in the bag when i check-in .
no , i just have a few plants .
not at all . i ' d like to have a clean bag .
it ' s a cd player . it ' s got a cassette player in it .
i ' m sorry sir . i didn ' t realize that . i ' ll have to think about it .
excuse me , is there anything wrong ?
oh , this is paul . when will he be back ?
can i leave a message for him ?
please tell him i'll call him at the office tomorrow afternoon .
thank you very much . bye .
hold on a second please . i'm sorry , he's gone out .
he will be back at about eleven o'clock .
yes , of course .
ok . i'll tell him .
what can i do for you , sir ?
which seems to be the trouble .
100 for immediate delivery , and 500 for 2 months . that's by the end of june .
yes , if i don't make it to work tomorrow morning , my wife will kill me . how does it cost ?
a 10,000 dollar policy shouldn't be too expensive . here , call my agent . he will give you a good deal .
yes , this is my overseas travel accident insurance card .
that's agood idea . you are a firecrackers and it can be dangerous .
i need to make sure that my husband is financially secure if i die .
that's true . well , how much do i have to get ?
good morning , sir . what can i do for you ?
thank you , mr . macmillan . i look forward to seeing you next week .
yes , mr . macmillan . just a moment , please . i'll check it for you .
i'm terribly sorry , mr . macmillan . i'll have to write it down .
what can i do for you , sir ?
i saw her yesterday . she was a little better .
no , you needn't . a number 13 bus will also take you to the hospital .
yes . i caught a number 13 bus yesterday , and they said i had taken the wrong bus .
but number 13 buses leave you from the center of town . you'll have to walk two miles to catch a bus .
we're going to the hospital to see susan .
must i catch a number 7 bus to get there ?
number 13 buses run much more frequently , but don't they ?
thank you , henry . i'll get a number 13 .
excuse me . may i see your boarding pass , please ?
please put your luggage here , sir .
it's just a regular inspection . do you have anything to declare ?
well , the cigarettes and the champagne are not in excess of the duty limit . but according to our law , each passenger is allowed only one camera duty-free . you'll have to pay duty for the other two .
please wait a moment . i'll make out a duty memo ... here you are . take this and pay to the woman over there .
very well . i hope you'll enjoy your stay in america .
here we are .
ok . but , is there something wrong ?
i've got six pounds of cigarettes and 2 packets of champagne . besides , i have two cameras , one is for my own use , and the other is a gift .
ok ... where shall i pay duty for it ?
i've paid for it . and here's the receipt .
ok , thank you .
good morning , sir . what can i do for you ?
yes , i am a staff member of nokia company .
i observed the interviewer ' s manner , his manner , and his way of conducting his work .
in this way , you should pay more attention to your words and expressions .
it is nice and nice to see you , too .
why do you want to work for us ?
good . what else can i do ?
excuse me , sir . may i see your passport , please ?
how do i do that ?
that ' s all i needed to know . thank you .
no ! stupid machine , what are you doing !
how do i put my card into the slot ? stupid machine !
i'm sorry , madam . you have to get it from the atm .
please input your pin code on the keypad . it will tell you what you want .
just type in the amount you wish to withdraw .

ok , that ' s it . just fill out this withdrawal form and sign your name on it .
excuse me , sir . could you tell me where the post office is ?
i am doing fantastic , joe . you ?
i would love to ! but i can ' t decide .
great ! where are you going ?
would you like to go to a movie ?
pretty good . how about you ?
what can i do for you ?
would you like to go to the movies with me ?
i was thinking about going to a movie by the river .
i wanted to go somewhere between a chick flick and a horror movie !
welcome to iba . what can i do for you ?
that would be very important . we also need a good accountant to help us with our business .
yes , we have . we ' ve got a good location in the northeast of the city . it ' s not far from the airport .
the branch office is too expensive to be located in a big city . do you think we can afford to pay a membership fee ?
how long does the branch office take ?
i think we should have a good advertising campaign to promote the opening .
we've got plenty of business to deal with , so we should be able to get plenty of clients by the end of the week .
first of all , we need to make sure that we have a good corporate culture and a good staff .
i think that we should send someone to help us . i don ' t think we should hire people , because they aren ' t familiar with the laws of the city . have you thought about the location ?
i think that we should choose a company that is familiar with the local laws and regulations .
yes , we have . we ' ve signed two contracts with other companies already . we hope to sign three more this month .
i think that our branch office should be in a good location . we should be able to set up a small office and open a little more quickly .
yes , it is . we ' re going to target the business community through business magazines and newspapers .
what can i do for you ?
may i have your valuables , please ?
may i see your boarding pass , please ?
good afternoon . i'd like to check out .
here you are .
yes , it's so valuable . thank you .
excuse me , could you tell me where the post office is ?
don't you know that our laws start at seven ? and we are going to meet at seven to seven . then it doesn't make sense .
yes , i think so . i just don't know what to do .
i know . so , what do you do about it ?
yeah , i agree , but i've learned a lot from watching movies .
do you think that you want to be a doctor in the future ?
i don't think that many people are ready to give up on a child .
of course , it ' s the same in many countries .
why do you think that ?
yes , it seems that she can't accept a child's parents .
do you think that it's a good idea ?
do you think that many people are trying to have the baby ?
yes , it is .
i hear that . my husband always make a fuss of her .
welcome to our company . what can i do for you ?
why don't you go to the library and do some reading ?
i know , but you should get out your english books and catch up on your reading assignments .
i know . but i'm not good at reading .
that's a good idea .
excuse me , could you tell me where the post office is ?
when do you think you will take over ?
i'd be happy to hear from you .
yes , i have made my decision .
we hope to notify you in the next couple of days .
good morning , sir . what can i do for you ?
are they looking for a studio ?
do they have apartments available ?
a one-bedroom apartment will be fine .
how long will it take to find a one-bedroom apartment ?
i found it in today ' s apartment ads .
if you need a roommate , you can ask them .
the rent for a one-bedroom apartment is $ 1050 a month .
how long will it take you to find a one-bedroom apartment ?
of course . i would be happy to .
what are you doing ?
a man robbed my house .
i thought you knew .
when did she have the baby ?
when did you know ?
i want to go and visit them .
no , what ?
how did you know ?
i didn't know anything .
that's amazing .
i'd love to .
i'm glad you told me .
good morning , sir . what can i do for you ?
i have to tell you something else that i really don ' t know .
i know what you mean . you should call the police .
i would love to , but i can ' t afford to .
i'm afraid i can't stand it any more .
i don ' t think so . i ' m worried .
good morning , sir . what can i do for you ?
i'm starting to eat healthier foods .
so why don't you eat healthier foods ?
if i were you , i would stick to the gym .
what do you think is the problem ?
that sounds like something i should try .
sometimes , you just don ' t know what to do .
i try lots of fruits , vegetables , and whole grains .
i don't really think so .
i don't want fruits , vegetables , and meat .
i don't like chicken because it's not healthy .
good morning . what can i do for you ?
nice to meet you , mr . smith .
nice to meet you too ! my name is karl williams .
thank you ! i appreciate it very much !
good morning . welcome to our office . what can i do for you ?
nice to meet you too ! miss williams .
i am very glad to meet you .
you are welcome !
is there anything i can do for you ?
what part-time job did you have ?
what kind of work did you do ?
what are the most important qualities an advertising planner should have ?
yes , i have . i was in the advertising department at a language school .
i used to report to clients and answer questions .
i think a person should have strong sense of responsibility and responsibility .
i think the most important thing is being able to see eye to eye with others .
excuse me , could you tell me how to get to the railway station ?
that would be convenient . they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . the circuit breakers kept going out all the time ! it ' s really annoying !
i know ! i were in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that evening ! the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
dan is on top of that . i think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
yeah you are right . this office is falling apart ! frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that ' s why the parking lot was flooded .
what do you want to eat ?
do you like going to a concert ?
would you like to go to a bar ?

what kind of music do you listen to ?
not really . i think pop music has much depth and vitality .
how long have you been involved in pop music ?
not really . when i was a little kid , i didn't really listen to any music .
so , when i was about 10 years old , i started playing the trumpet .
yes , that's one of my favorite .
good morning , sir . may i help you ?

i'd like to buy a new bicycle .
i thought it was sunny and bright .
i don't think we have enough time to waste .
do you think it's going to get worse ?

i was a naughty boy and i did not listen to the teacher very well .
what can i do for you ?
what's wrong with it ?
i'm sorry that she can't make it to her place .

it's a great opportunity to learn something new .
i hope you can learn how to enjoy your work .

i see . you are what you eat . it's not only a daily routine , but a weekly routine .
yeah , you're right . i just don't know what to tell you .
why don't you open it and tell me what horoscopes are like ?

no , i don't . i think i'm in the rut !

how can you be so sure ?
i can't believe what he said .
i feel confident he will cure my daughter's disease .
i can tell from the way he speaks .
welcome to our bank . what can i do for you ?
i don't think we should invite him . he's too excited about seeing movies on tv .
that would be a good idea . why don't we ask him to play ? he loves to play .
you're right , we should invite him to watch movies .
do you need help with something ?
but kids like watching things like that .
personally speaking , i'm not for it , i feel it's bad for kids to watch .
if you ask me , i have to disagree . they shouldn't be shown for fun .

i'd like to have a chinese restaurant .
yes , i am . what's on ?
that sounds good . where shall we meet ?
ok , i'll pick you up there .

what are they good at ?
he ' s very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .

i'm very pleased with their performances . they can cover over 100 meters in 10 minutes .
he ' s not bad at the long jump , but he ' s very good at the high jump .
the longest race i ' ve ever run is the 1500 meters .
they ' re ok . they ' re very good at the 1500 meters . that ' s a long way to go . it ' s not very fast , though .

i think you are right . it is very nice of you to say so .
yes , i would . thanks for the advice .
is there anything i can do for you ?
well , at the beginning of the month we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon . in the middle of the week , the days are longer and the nights are longer . this is due to the fact that we set the clock forward for daylight
well , now that i think about it , we are in california , aren ' t we ? that ' s when we were in beijing .
yes , i did . but why do we have to do that ?
i see . that's convenient , but what do you mean ?

have you ever been to a chinese restaurant ?
oh , i see . but how do you use them ?
yes , of course . there are a multitude of rules that foreigners might never know until they were chinese . some practices even appear awkward or rude to foreigners .
perhaps you should have placed them horizontally over your mouth or plate . they resemble incense sticks .
yes . i haven't been invited to a chinese feast for a long time .
to begin with , you have to use chopsticks and utensils .
yes . i used to be quite clumsy when i was a child , but now i am proficient .
then what do you usually use ?

i'm going to have to wait for the police . i really need to see them .
i don't understand why you didn't do it . why didn't you just do it ?
i was supposed to stay in the lane you were in . but i didn't .
i'm going to have to call the police .
what's wrong ? i'm in a hurry .
i had to stay in the lane i was in .
i thought you had a right to stay in the lane you were in .
i know what you mean . but i'm not going to be able to do that . i'm going to have to go to the hospital .
alright . i'll try .

so , i don't see that happening ?
my mother-in-law used to do the same thing to me . if she wasn't disciplining us enough , then we were disciplining them too much .
not much , except that my sister-in-law is driving me up the wall .
she likes to nit-pick my food , and criticizes everything i do with her .
well , last week i invited her over to dinner . my husband and i had no problem with it , but if you listened to her , then it would seem like i fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . there's nothing wrong with it .
it's not just that . she also criticizes how we raise our kids .
excuse me , could you tell me how to get to the railway station ?

that's not the gadgets . creating programmes is a good idea . they stimulate thoughts .

i see . do you like watching the winter olympics ?
what do you think of the winter olympics ?
why don't you go to the winter olympics with me ? we can play together .
yes , i do . i like the tradition of winter olympic games .
i can't agree with you more . the olympic games are a very exciting game .

that's a family . how long is your brother ?
so you think it should be better that he should be told about .

that's right , sarah and julie are both your cousins although they are step-sisters .
that must be wonderful . do anything interesting ?
yes , i am looking forward to meeting with your family .

he looks to be a very responsible boy .
well , he uses our laptop at home . but he's going to university in the fall , so he needs his own car .

why do you choose to be a good mother ?
what is the most important thing to me ?
yes . i think i'm polite , careful and relaxed .
it's easy to be a working mother , but you just have to keep it in mind that you are what you eat .
my husband is an american . he criticizes me when i do that . he says that i can't change his attitude by using force .
good morning , sir . may i help you ?
i have been thinking about this for a long time , but i have no clue what to say .
i agree with you , but i don ' t know what to say .
i think that ' s important for me to be clear about what i want to say .
i ' m sure i could do that .
i don ' t know what to say . i have lots of ideas , but they never seem to come out of my mouth .
don ' t worry about it . it ' s just part of being a teenager . you need to be open to new ideas and make new ideas .
i think you ' ll need to think about what you are going to say .
i think the most important thing is that you know what you are talking about . if the topic is a topic you want to talk about , then you need to prepare for it .
i agree with you , but i ' m not sure what else you can do to express my opinion .
what's wrong with you ?
but mr . thomas liked it .
he used to be a surveyor .
he's a private eye now .

the best way is to make plans and set priorities . it helps me to manage my time well and to get the most important things done at the first time .
yes , i have been working for eight hours . i am exhausted .
you know , mr . brown . nowadays , it is not easy to find a job that is not in line with my job experience .
good morning . can i help you ?
i want to buy some material for a paper i ' m writing .
or maybe make the beds .
thanks . that ' s terrific , !
could you help me ?
i ' ll be glad to help .
all you have to do is ask for your help .
i ' m glad and willing to help .
is there anything i can do for you ?
i ordered some fried spring rolls .
yes , i'd like to . but i'm not good at cooking .
what kind of chinese food do you want ?
i can't wait to try their dishes .
i'd love to . but i don't know what to do .
excuse me . can you tell me where the railway station is ?
why don't you take a rest ? you'll feel much better .
why don't you call your doctor and tell her about it ?
you're really hot . let me get you some tylenol .
just get some rest , and you'll feel better in a few days .
i think you've got a lot of red rash all over you . are you allergic to anything ?
i completely forgot about your cat allergy . i took care of a cat allergy for a few days ago . oh , no . it's better now .
ok , but let's just go and see if there's an opening now before we get worse .
well , i need to do that . i have an important meeting .
not at all . i just feel a little under the weather .
ok , i'll call my doctor and see if he's got a fever .
thanks a lot . i'll stay home and rest , but if i feel better in the afternoon , i'm going to the meeting .
i don't think so . it looks a bit red , but i'm sure it's nothing .
sounds good , but i don't think i'll be near any other cats or dogs for the next few days .
i'll make an appointment first .
whatever you say . i just want to get to my meeting .
good morning . can i help you ?
that's too bad . i'm sorry .
what can i do for you ?
so , what was hardest about you ?
really ? what do you mean ?
yes , i do . i'm not sure what i want to do .
of course . as you are a doctor , we pay a lot of attention to what we are doing .
usually the first thing is to let them know that they are not in danger .
do you have a minute ?
no , i haven't .
good morning , sir . what can i do for you ?
which season do you like best ?
how about forgetlessly summer ?
why , why ?
but sometimes summer is much more delightful than the other seasons .
let's go out for a walk .
i like spring .
i dislike it awful .
because the hottest season is the summer in my country .
excuse me , do you know where the railway station is ?
yes , he did .
it was a real red letter for him .
good morning . what can i do for you ?
it's ... oh it's the first of april , april fool's day .
poor old fellow , what's the date today , buddy ?
you forget all about it , didn't you ?
good morning , sir . can i help you ?
what ? can ' t you stay a little longer ?
good morning , sir . what can i do for you ?
then , i ' ll come down here and see what i can do .
that ' s too bad , do you have any other car ?
yes , that ' s right . i made a reservation for a mid-size vehicle .
thank you , i ' ll take it .
thank you . i appreciate it .
yes , mr . fox . we have a reservation under the name of foster .
yes , we have a reservation under the name of foster .
i ' m sorry , we can ' t do that .
i ' m sorry , we can ' t do that .
ok , i ' ll put it in the waiting list for you .
what do you think of the teacher ?
do you think tom will get it ?
i don't think so .
ok , loser gets a shot .
welcome to our bank . what can i do for you ?
you know , in a sense , a dress is compulsory for male employees even in july , and no jewelry allowed . even the casual clothes are not permitted .
but it is unjust to judge a book by its cover . if they ' re not happy and comfortable with the clothes , they can be less productive !
well , i was wondering how people in your company dress . i know what you mean .
to some extent , it is . however , if they like to wear formal clothes , they should give it a try .
what do you think of the teacher ?
did he ? did he win ?
maybe he was busy with his work . why didn't we tell him ?
did he take any drugs ?
i thought he was supposed to win .
he was supposed to win , but he didn't .
i didn't think he'd win .
you mean he didn't ?
i thought he had a good chance .
i don't know . maybe he was taking illegal drugs .
i know . he was supposed to win the gold , but he didn't .
he was supposed to win the gold , but he didn't .
i thought he was supposed to win , but he didn't .
excuse me , could you tell me how to get to the railway station ?
what's the difference between sitcoms and others ?
i see . what about the difference between the two shows ?
that's true . i've heard that americans have an all-time favorite sitcom .
no , i don't think so . it's just a old sitcom .
in taiwan , most of the shows are comedies .
what are you going to do this weekend ?
why do you want to know more about it ?
i don ' t think history repeats itself all the time .
the idea is that things change constantly , but the reason why they happen stays the same .
yes , i am . i enjoyed reading them when i was studying it at school .
i see . when i was a little boy , i had a lot of trouble remembering all the dates .
what do you mean ?
that ' s true , but i don ' t agree with that . people often seem to make the same mistakes over and over again .
good morning , sir . what can i do for you ?
thank you for saying so .
excuse me , could you tell me how to get to the railway station ?
well , if i were you , i'd go on a traveling .
it's true . you have to make the best decision .
how much would you have to pay ?
don't worry about it . i can give you a hand .
i've been feeling a little under the weather lately . i've got a terrible headache .
thanks a lot . i have to face the reality now .
well , if i took a chance , i would get more .
i'd like to , but i'm afraid i can't .
thanks . i appreciate it .
excuse me . can you tell me where the post office is ?
b , y , l , a , b , l .
it ' s a i , a y .
good morning , sir . what can i do for you ?
i don ' t envy those who are filthy with dough .
i think we should win one or two medals in the paralympics .
who ' s the first woman to win a gold in the olympics ?
i ' m sure so . now that i think about it , it ' s a long way to go . if i take the long route , we may come across a traffic jam .
i can ' t believe it . he must be very disappointed .
i ' m not sure . jordan is the best athlete i ' ve seen in the olympics , but he won three gold medals in the paralympics .
a world record ? not just a world record , i ' m a hundred percent certain .
i suppose so . i think we ' ll win a lot in the olympics .
excuse me , sir . can i help you ?
not at all . helen , i hope you can come .
no , just bring yourself . i want to see you there .
yes , i heard that . when ?
i will , but do you want to bring anything ?
excuse me . can you tell me where the railway station is ?
poor guy ! he will take long to get a wife .
really ? what happened ?
it's unbelievable . he used to be a rough husband .
excuse me . may i help you ?
i will teach you how .
do you have a hand ?
you won a prize ?
ok . let's go .
don't worry . i can teach you quickly .
yes , i am . but i'm not good at chess .
you won a prize for beginners ?
welcome to lincoln bank . what can i do for you ?
how long have you been here ?
oh , i see . i remember when i was in guangzhou , my girlfriend was haggling with a sales clerk over the price of a phone .
a shouting match ? i am sorry .
hmm . chinese usually don ' t notice that sort of thing . maybe it ' s quite natural .
yeah , about four months .
yeah , i think so .
yeah , i know that . but the speed of conversation went faster and faster , until i realized that it was a shouting match .
that's not exaggerating at all . i was telling you the truth .
oh , i see .
excuse me , could you tell me the way to the railway station ?
not really ! what about the names ?
well , i haven't finished it yet .
no , i've read it a lot before .
thank you so much . i'm glad to read it .
i appreciate you help .
why not ? it's a classic and it's one of my favorite .
the book's all on the shelf .
no , not very funny at all .
do you like this book ?
why do you like that book ?
you dance beautifully . do you like the hero ?
that sounds wonderful . what time is it playing ?
welcome to our bank . what can i do for you ?
i suppose we'll see just around .
you too . karren ?
thanks , tim ! nice meeting you again , too .
hey . i hope so . well . take it easy .
excuse me , do you know where the post office is ?
why ? why not talk to him ? it's nothing serious .
i know what you mean . i'm tired of all the office power !
why don't you talk to him ?
i know what you mean . i don't want to lose my job ! i'm sick of all this power !
i'm not trying to get promoted . i'm trying to be a good boss , not a bad one .
i just lost my job !
i spent months trying to get this position , but nothing came out of the oven !
i'm talking about all the bells and whistles in the office !
i don't know . i don't think the boss has the guts to tell me that !
i don't think that's the right way to feel about it . i'm just fed up with it .
good morning , sir . what can i do for you ?
i think someone is purposefully stalking me .
i don't know . i saw him the first time tuesday . he was at the cafe . i noticed him was looking at me a lot . not just the usual staring , but looking . he just kept staring at me .
i didn't do anything . finally , he left . but then i saw him again today . outside the shoe store . near the cafe . i went in a cd store and pretended i was looking at cd's . but afterwards he came in too .
yes . then i noticed him was on the sidewalk behind me . he was stop me .
what is it ? what comes ?
no , it can't be . really . who ?
what did you do ?
did he even leave when you left ?
then did you do what ?
good morning , sir . what can i do for you ?
i like chinese food . would you recommend me some ?
i'm not sure . do you know where it is ?
sure , i'd love to .
i don't know . what do you want to eat ?
i really like chinese food . do you know a good place ?
yes , it's just down the block from my apartment .
i'd like to try it .
do you have any questions ?
the one in california is disneyland .
well , i've never been to either one of them , so i was thinking of going to disneyworld .
that sounds good . where shall we go ?
that sounds great . where do you think we will go ?
that's a good idea . i'd love to .
how about going to the roller coasters that go through tunnels ?
thanks for inviting me . i'll talk to my husband about it .
yes , i've been to disneyworld a couple of times .
that's right . why didn't you ask my parents ?
when are you planning on going ?
that sounds like a good idea . let's go !
how long will it take to get there ?
why don't you think about going to the one in florida ?
that sounds great . do you think we'll have fun ?
i'm sure he will love it . he loves the roller coaster rides and the roller coasters .
what can i do for you ?
it's almost a year now .
i've been pretty good . how about you ?
not yet . i'm still looking through the classifieds , but i haven't found one yet .
that's a good idea .
me too . i'm looking forward to living in this neighborhood .
steven ? i haven't seen you for ages !
how have you been ?
have you found a place yet ?
it's a pleasure . i hope you can help .
that's a good idea . i hope you can help .
sure . let me know if you need any help .
good morning , sir . what can i do for you ?
why don't you just put your pants on ?
look at your pants ! they're so cute !
i don't think i'm going to buy anything .
yeah . what are you looking for ?
what are you going to buy ?
that sounds like fun . let's go !
what's your name ?
he is in prison for a few days .
no , i'm telling you .
well , i heard that he has got a new position .
no , what happened ?
that's good news .
i was sorry for a million .
that's too bad .
excuse me , could you tell me how to get to the central park ?
why don't you go with me ?
i have to go now .
ok , i'll go tomorrow morning .
how much do you need to pay ?
do you want to go with me ?
ok . do you want to go with me ?
sure . i need to buy some stuff .
it closes at six every day .
why don't you come with me ? we can go together .
i want to buy some fruit .
ok , let's go .
that's good . we can go together .
ok . i'm ready .
excuse me , sir . can i help you ?
i don't feel well .
no , i haven't . what about you ?
do you need help with something ?
it's julie .
excuse me , sir . may i help you ?
he borrowed some money from me , and i didn ' t have the funds .
i think so . he probably feels that you mistrusted him .
no , but he borrowed a lot of money from me .
no , we didn ' t . he probably thought you were right . you should patch things up .
why did you argue so much ?
well , he should pay you back . it ' s just not fair .
did you lend him a lot of money yesterday ?
don ' t worry . he ' ll pay you back as soon as he can .
of course you should . you didn ' t want to get into such a silly argument .
excuse me . can you tell me where the railway station is ?
maybe so . but a law banning smoking would do no good .
i don't think so . i think the government should do everything it can to discourage people from smoking .
i don ' t think so . the government can prohibit smoking in public places .
excuse me , do you know where the post office is ?
the aquarium is very narrow , you know .
that sounds like a good story .
i think so . but i don't know how to explain it .
yeah , but i'm not there for fun . i have to remain professional and if i get busy , the manager would be furious .
not everything , but nearly . he speaks very clearly and doesn't use very complex words so it is easy for us to understand .
excuse me , ma'am . can i take your order now ?
and i suppose sitting at a desk all day in the office doesn't work .
i do wish i could lose more weight .
i've tried diets before , but they've never really worked .
yes , maybe i should go jogging .
oh i am not surprised , you eat too much .
no , i wouldn't think like so .
well . why don't you go on a diet ?
perhaps you should excercise less . why don't you go to an exercise class .
what can i do for you ?
here you are .
here you are .
i think we should go now .
yes , a new place .
you mean it is a new space ?
i'm sorry . we've sold out of the tickets .
thank you . you're very kind .
ok . here you are .
ok . here you are .
you know it is a new place , isn't it ?
yes , we should .
good morning , sir . what can i do for you ?
the documentary also pointed out that dogs are used by people to find people trapped under rubble or rubble .
don ' t forget that horses are still used in many countries to pull ploughs and carls .
yes , i ride regularly . however , i don ' t ride often .
that ' s a good idea .
i love dogs . they have been used as guards for centuries . nowadays , they are often used to find illegal drugs or bombs by the government and customs officers .
horses are useful to people too . we use them for transportation and recreation .
can horses ride a horse ?
i ride too . perhaps we could go horse riding together some day ?
excuse me . may i help you ?
ok . i'll tell her .
thank you . mrs . johnson .
okay , tom .
she's in her office .
i'm afraid she's gone .
of course . what do you want ?
you're welcome .
where's lisa ?
are you going to cook dinner tonight ?
what do you think of the new television channel ?
he was arrested last week .
no , i was telling you so fast .
but he took the job when he was just 20 years old .
no , who's calling ?
i'm sorry .
that's a promotion for a $ 350 purse .
that's too bad . he did a good job .
good morning , sir . what can i do for you ?
let's hope so .
if we hurry up , we'll miss the train .
excuse me , could you tell me how to get to the central park ?
there are many kinds of sports , such as basketball , swimming , skating , badminton and so on .
ok , let's go .
don't worry , bruce will make it .
that's great . i will try my best .
yes , it is my first time to attend the meeting .
i am very interested in the long-distance race , but i am not good at it .
we will participate in the national championship .
i hope he can make it .
ok , i will try my best .
what are you doing , steven ?
and i think he ' s dull , aren ' t they ?
he just doesn ' t smile very often .
really ? i can ' t believe it .
can i help you ?
no , i'm glad to hear it . i hope it's not too much trouble .
yes , i have . i enjoyed it very much .
excuse me , could you tell me where the railway station is ?
someone claimed that it was the man-made wonders that could be imagined on the moon .
yes , it is . it has many attractions in it .
that's true . it's really worth visiting .
excuse me . i was wondering if you could help me .
no , i don ' t know how to play the drums .
there ' s a guy who plays guitar , a girl who plays bass , and a guy that plays bass .
i didn ' t know that . i thought you were pretty good .
how often do you play a music ?
what kind of music do you want to play ?
well , i ' m a singer , but i don ' t sing very well .
well , i ' m not sure . i don ' t have enough room for the amplifiers , microphones , and microphones .
what can i do for you , sir ?
how would you like it ?
i ' d like to have a christmas pudding .
i asked him to bring me a gift .
what can i do for you , sir ?
well , lili , we can go to new york in august . we don ' t have to take a plane or stay in a hotel this time .
we can sleep in our van .
well , i don ' t think we can afford that . we are going to spend a lot of money .
lili , let ' s go ! i can ' t wait !
that ' s great . let ' s go !
let ' s go !
i don ' t think we can . vacations cost money .
where will we go ? we can stay in the van 10 .
ok , george . where are we going ?
why don ' t we go to taiwan instead ? it ' s quiet there .
well , george , we don ' t have much money left after paying the rent .
let ' s go to hawaii . we can have lunch there .
what can i do for you , sir ?
yes , i will make note of that .
when will we be on the bus ?
yes , someone will be picking me up at school .
we will return on december 8th at 8
we plan to go on the field trip on the first saturday of next month .
how many days will we spend on the trip ?
i will make sure that we have enough time to get to school .
we will return on december 8th at 8 o'clock in the morning .
the bus will arrive at 8 o'clock in the morning , and we will get there in time .
excuse me , could you tell me how to get to the railway station ?
don't be so critical . there's no reason for it .
i'm glad to meet you .
don't be too critical . he should expect it to be perfect .
what can i do for you ?
it was a nightmare . i had no time at all .
good morning , sir . what can i do for you ?
i have been working here for five or five years .
no , sometimes . i don't like working nights i have problems sleeping during the week .
to be frank , not very much , because i can't use much much what i've learned in my job . i enjoy doing more challenging work .
good . do you know anything about this boss ?
i ' m looking forward to meeting with you again and getting started on my new job .
have you known your salary , mr . black ?
do you get paid overtime ?
i know what you mean , but i'd prefer to be cold tempered .
which team are you going to employ ?
excuse me , could you tell me where the wal-mart supermarket is ?
it's easy to say . everyone knows that there are nine heavens and one planet .
what ? ed , don't tell me you only have bad news !
yes ! we have all assumed that you were the shy , shy person .
that's easy ! who knows what there are ?
so what is he meant to do ?
i hope so . i hope it doesn't take long .
excuse me , could you tell me where the post office is ?
you should have told me you were in love with her .
you know that you are in love with her .
yes , but you might have told me something .
you can't be serious . how dare you not tell me you are going to marry her ?
oh , you are men ? you're all the same .
sorry , i thought you probably knew .
didn't i mean ?
i didn't know that you weren't in love .
i did not think you might be interested .
sorry , i didn't think it would ever ever happen .
how about the new television channel ?
mary thought that she was really nice with the photography .
she likes the acting , too , because that's what she wanted to see .
nothing is to your taste .
oh , i didn't like it .
i feel it sounds very disappointing .
i wasn't really happy with it .
excuse me , could you tell me where i can get a shopping basket ?
i ' m going to my parent ' s concert .
well , first of all , i like to pamper myself ! my nails look great !
i don ' t want to have nail polish or nail polish ! i want my nails to look great !
where are you going ?
really ? why don ' t you just tell me ?
honey , i don ' t want to have nail polish or anything like that !
yeah , sounds like something we should definitely do !
good morning . may i help you ?
i'm doing well , thank you . are you ?
yes , it's nice , but it's also very rainy .
what's the weather like in your city ?
where do you live ?

quite well too , thank you very much . is it a nice day ?
yes , but it's hot .
well ... it's quite warm right now .
in london . where do you live then ?
excuse me , could you tell me where the post office is ?
that ' s what i ' m going to do ! i ' ve decided to grow my own company , get some investors and start working for myself !
no , i haven ' t ! i ' ve never written up a business plan before !
well , that sounds easy enough !
that sounds like a good idea ! do you have any ideas ?
well , i think i ' ll just stick to my old job and save myself the trouble of starting a company !
what are you doing ? you just quit your job ?
why don ' t you just start writing up a business plan ?
i ' m not going to write a business plan ! i ' m going to describe my company in a few words .
then what are you going to do ?
there are a lot of important points in a business plan . first of all , you have to describe your goals and objectives . second , you need to describe how you are going to spend your time and money . after all , the most important thing is how you will
good morning , sir . can i help you ?
did she know what her father did ?
yeah , i heard .
she got into an argument with her boyfriend .
what can i do for you , sir ?
yeah ... but we haven't seen anything at all . you seem sort of under the weather . is there something going on ?
it's too biased . i just didn't like their one-sided reporting .
i plan to go for a vacation . how about you ?
there's a reality tv program about a family who are trying to lose weight .
what can i do for you ?
hmm , i don ' t want to watch that .
i don ' t like it . it ' s too boring .
i ' m sorry . i didn ' t think you were a girl .
i don ' t know . i just want to watch the reality show .
i ' m sorry . i don ' t want to watch that show .
i ' m not sure . what is it ?
come on , it ' s a good show . let ' s go .
i don ' t know what to tell you .
i don ' t want it . it ' s just funny .
i don ' t think so . it ' s just a show for girls .
good morning , sir . what can i do for you ?
i heard many parents are forcing their children to learn something they don ' t love .
what are you talking about ?
you said it . many parents just don ' t understand what to educate their children .
what do you think of the teacher ?
did you go out ?
what did you buy ?
i like it .
where did you find it ?
that's very nice of you .
i don't think that i bought it today .
i had a really busy day . i had to work a little overtime . in the morning an important client called to place a large order with my colleagues .
i bought a lot of new things .
i bought a few new computer games .
i bought it at the mall .
no , it wasn't . it looked nice .
i bought it a couple of weeks ago .
good morning , sir . what can i do for you ?
so are you , victor ?
why ? what's wrong ?
well , why don't you go to bed then ?
i'm fine , thanks . how about you ?

welcome to lincoln bank . what can i do for you ?
if the phoenix beats 21 , it will enter the final .
the phoenix team overpowered its counterpart 86 to 50 .
if so , it will enter the final .
what's wrong with you ? you look pale .
how in the world did you get a copy ? i've put a hold on it at the public library for days and i're still waiting my turn .
did it really worth fighting for ?
if it's any good , i'll buy a copy when it come out in the pocket edition .
it's the best seller everyone's been talking about for the last six months .
i checked it out of the rental library ? it only costs five cents a day .
i can't tell yet . i haven't got beyond reading the first chapter .
what can i do for you ?
i was just trying to catch the breath .
i am sorry , honey . i have got to go .
but could you please turn off the air-conditioner ? my hands are sticky .
but jogging is good for you , too .
don't worry , honey . i will help you .
but i did not mean to . i was just thinking about it .
i know , honey , but i think i need to run .
i am sorry , honey . i was so sorry .
well , i guess it is good for you and your health .
oh , honey , i don't need to . i'm just tired .
can i help you , sir ?
i have been looking for a job for myself , and i haven ' t found one yet . it ' s so hard finding work these days . have you had any luck ?
to be honest , i don't like them at all . they are too scary for me .
it's sounds like fun , but i don't want to see it .
i see . how long have you been fond of horror films ?
what's the matter with you ? you seem quite in a hurry .
fine , thanks . what are you watching ?
oh , how many horror films have you been watching ?
you are kidding me . i don't know what to do .
i bet . you must be stoked about the idea of watching a movie with a friend .
sure , i love horror films .
i see . anyway , i'll prepare some vegetarian food for dinner . see you then .
excuse me , sir . can you tell me where the railway station is ?
that's a good idea , but i don't think the government needs to do much to stimulate the economy .
what do you mean ? i don't think we're heading for a recession . we're in a mess .
that's just the short in the arm , not the long on the long .
are you ready to order ?
i love going to an art exhibition , particularly when i am holding an exhibition of abstract art .
art isn ' t for everyone . i ' m going to an exhibition tomorrow . it is an exhibition of abstract art .
i thought i ' d have an early lunch and go immediately afterwards . did you want to go ?
why don ' t you meet me there ? it will probably take us a while to see an exhibition .
not really . i like going to an art exhibition once a year . i hardly know anything about art . are you a true art lover ?

yeah , maybe it does . but if you're going to drive like you did just now , you have to get used to a little pain . you know what i mean ?
don't think too much . i think you'll recover soon .
maybe we should have got off the bus and went to the mall .

i promise me that i will keep it up .
i have fallen in love with my boss .
no , he's still single .
i am trying to keep it to myself , but there is a lot of gossip about him .
ok , i will .
yes , i need a lot of support .
what's wrong with you ? you look miserable .
with the current job ?
a good weekend for you . you need a holiday .
what exact do you mean ?
you need a holiday ? that's what's the matter .
oh , nothing special . i'm just a little stressed .

it wasn't always this ways , you know .
well , i always get a little moody when i'm out .
sure , perhaps .
welcome to our company . what can i do for you ?
isabelle ? why are you hiding behind a tree ?
what a bummer ! what did you tell me ?
how dare you ! i didn't mean to hurt you !
why did you lie to me ?

he said he'd be wearing a white hat .
i'm the guy , amabelle . i can't believe it !
sorry , logan . i didn't mean to hurt you .

how many kinds of fish do you eat ?
what kind of fruit do you like ?
how often do you exercise ?

yes , i do , but i don't eat many potatoes .
i drink a lot of coffee , but i seldom drink much .
good morning , sir . may i help you ?
did you watch it ?
who was the champion ?
how did brazil compete ?
no , i missed it .
seattle volleyball .
china managed a 99:98 victory .
excuse me , sir . can i have your name , please ?
we don't have a dress code in our company , so it's hard to tell .
how many times do you wear formal clothes in a company ?
what kind of formal clothing do you want people to wear ?
i know , that's not true . most people like to go out in jeans to get a good impression of their company .
what do you mean ? you don't have to dress casually to work !
may i help you ?
look at these tall tall tall buildings over there .
that's quite famous , isn't it ?
what else are we going to see ?
what's that building over there ?
what are all these tall buildings ?
what do you mean ?
yes , look at the empire state building over there .
no , but when it was built in 1930 , it was a marvel of engineering and engineering .
there are many . actually , every skyscraper has a history . a few blocks away we'll see the empire state building .
well , there are a lot of them . the park on fifth avenue is one of the most famous .
most of them are office buildings , huge department stores , and hotels . some are just private homes .
what can i do for you ?
i didn't realize you were single ! are you identical or what ?
i hear her boyfriend is handsome . why is that ?
so your younger sister is older than you ?
after going through an episode like that i'm not surprised . how's her headspace ?
and just one question . would you like to be a translator ?
i know what you mean , kevin . it's not easy being together .
well , i am just shopping .
she thinks it has about twenty-five years or thirty-three years of age .
no , they are both very supportive , but they need to figure out what to do .
well , i was only there for three days , so we didn't do too much . we went shopping and went out to dinner a couple of times . and at night we walked around the community with some friends .
nearly 10 years old . my parents are very strict about it .
you wouldn't do it until tomorrow , will you ?
i'll say , she is really worked up , isn't she ?
what can i do for you ?
i think so .
you're right . he's good for her .
i think so .
i like him . he's a good husband .
what do you think of the new television channel ?
what do you think ?
well , frankly speaking , i went to see him for the second time yesterday .
he has been feeling under a lot of stress lately .
good morning , mr . black .
i don't think we have .
let me see . oh ! here you are . what's the matter ?
excuse me , can you tell me how to get to the railway station ?
i suppose she's right . does she speak english very easily ?
it must be interesting to study english .
is that english pronunciation easy , or difficult ?
oh , we never talk spanish in class . miss , parker speaks to us only in english .
not always . sometimes we don't understand her . then he has to use what i said .
marriott and i are the best students in the class . miss parker says that my pronunciation is very good .
sometimes it's difficult . few words seem different from the way one pronounces them .
good morning , mr . white . what can i do for you ?
and even it takes two weeks .
that's a good idea .
i don't like it . it's too cold .
it's so wonderful .
is it real ?
but i agree with you .
what about coming for a walk or a walk ?
good idea . let's go !
i've got it . i like playing on the ice .
the snow is so beautiful . let's go !
excuse me , sir . can i see your boarding pass ?
i don't know why .
do you have any hobbies ?
oh , they ' re unbelievable .
that ' s marvelous !
wow , jordan ' s slam-dunks are marvelous .
which team do you think will win ?
they are the guys that are going to be promoted to general manager .
who ' s shaquille o ' neal ?
look at michael jordan .
he ' s bigger , so he doesn ' t slam , like he did when he was younger .
the lakers ? jordan is the only good player chuck has .
good morning , sir . what can i do for you ?
i was wondering if you could help me with the packing .
is it far from here ?
i see . what do you mean ?
is there anything else ?
i see . thanks for your time .
that's good . thanks for coming .
pleased to meet you again , mr . black .
you should go to the international student office .
the international center is a place where people can exchange information and exchange money .
as a matter of fact , most of them are from other countries .
that's a good idea . thank you very much .
that's a good idea . thank you very much .
thank you . i appreciate your help .
excuse me , sir . could you tell me where the post office is ?
i have been trying to find a job recently .
the news says that the inflation is going to rise again .
why do you have to pay such a high price ?
yes , of course . we have to increase our disposable income every year .
i hope you can find some new clothes soon .
i think we should buy some new clothes .
it seems that the government is clamping down on the spending .
i can't make ends meet these days .
my income is not the same as usual , but the rent is rising .
yeah . i have to spend far more money on food every month .
why don't you try to find some cheaper food ?
i have to buy some clothes for my family .
i hope it will continue for a long time .
that's true . i don't know how to make ends meet .
i hope you can find a way to meet your expenses .
excuse me , could you tell me where the post office is ?
would you mind waiting a moment while i check with the guys ?
ok , i will try my best .
i ' m sorry . i ' ve got to go now .
in that case , you should never touch the player's shirt .
let's play !
good morning , sir . can i help you ?
what is it ?
what does that mean ?
i see . what's that ?
maybe that's because we have different ideas about privacy .
yeah , that's not rare . i've seen people reading newspaper while taking a metro .
yeah , i think that is important .
yeah , totally . but there is one problem .
well , in order to adapt to the lifestyle in china , you have to pay a lot of attention to what people eat .
well , first of all , i don't want to look at others in the street . i want to be part of my own people .
yeah , but i never do that in public places .
i think so .
that's true . but i don't think that's a good idea .
i'd like to .
what do you think of the movie ?
what courses did you take in college ?
i took accounting and english as my minor subjects .
english . i liked english very much .
what ' s the matter ? you look pale .
every time i try to log on to a computer , it freezes .
can you tell me how to use it ?
i see . so what do you do on the internet ?
is that what you want to get ?
no , i haven't . what's the trouble ?
well , i often do business through the internet . it's very convenient .
sure . there is a website about it . you can check it on it .
that's great . i'll try it .
good morning , sir . what can i do for you ?
yes , i'd love to . do you know where it is ?
excuse me , is this where i can find the scholar bookstore ?
oh , is it ? thank you .
ok . thank you .
let me see . this seat is taken .
you ' re welcome .
good morning , sir . what can i do for you ?
but i heard they are very nutritious .
i don't think potatoes are very good .
i don't think you have a point here .
what's wrong with you ? you look pale .
that's okay . i'm sorry .
sorry , i just can't . i'm broke .
do you have any experience in guiding ?
what kind of climate do you like best ?
take me to malaysia .
yes , i do .
excuse me , could you tell me where the post office is ?
i'm glad we did .
so , what do you think of them ?
good morning , sir . what can i do for you ?
yes , he does . he loves her very much .
a girl he met at a party last week .
no , they haven ' t .
what ' s wrong ?
who is he marring ?
what ' s the wedding like ?
what's wrong with you ? you look pale .
yes , but the class has been very long .
come on , darling . it's time for school .
hurry up , baby . hurry up !
does the class start again , david ?
i am sorry , mam . i have to go now .
