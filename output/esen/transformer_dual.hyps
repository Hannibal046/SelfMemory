( 1 ) Auto-Oil programmes , which started in 1992 to provide a cost-setting basis for standards on vehicle emissions and fuel quality standards for the year 2000 and later , in order to achieve the air quality objectives , with particular emphasis on reducing road transport emissions , recognised that the level of maintenance of the motor vehicle is a key factor in the effect that traffic on air quality is traffic .

In order to account it is likely that the objective of reducing energy consumption is not linear and that sector by sector to move through progressive thresholds .

( 7 ) In addition , Council Decision 2004 / 650 / EC of 13 September 2004 amending Regulation ( EC ) No 998 / 2003 &amp; # 91 ; 2 &amp; # 93 ; added Malta to the list of countries in part A of Annex II to this Regulation .

( 61 ) The significant increase in consumption on the free market in 2000 and 2001 is partially explained by the greater economic activity of the Community and the world market and partly by the application of a new export licensing system in the PRC , involving massive purchases ( stock cumulation by users ) at the end of 2000 and 2001 on the basis of a possible shortage of raw materials and the product concerned .

( 2 ) In order not to create disturbance on the market before and after 1 May 2004 , the timetable for the tranches provided for in Commission Regulation ( EC ) No 1432 / 94 ( 3 ) for the year 2004 must be altered and the allocation of quantities adjusted without however altering the overall quantities provided for in Regulation ( EC ) No 774 / 94 .
