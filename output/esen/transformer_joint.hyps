( 24 ) The investigation has shown that the export quantities from the PRC to the Community for inward processing increased significantly between 2000 and the IP ( see recital 33 ) . If measures are repealed , it would be expected that exports from the PRC would also significantly increase outside the inward processing regime , given the significant price difference between the furfuraldehyde and that of the Community producers and that of the unused capacity as explained in recital ( 26 ) .

All Member States ( except MT and UK ) have explicitly adopted the single form and envisaged a number of possible means of transmission . In this respect , it is a difficult problem that the Framework Decision does not provide for the provisional arrest claim to an Interpol alert , contrary to the SIS ( Article 9 ( 3 ) ) . Pending the application of the second Schengen Information System ( SIS II ) , each Member State could remedy this difficulty by a national provision .
3.1.4 The concept of &amp; quot ; serious crimes &amp; quot ; ( which by definition includes &amp; quot ; at least &amp; quot ; the activities referred to in Article 3 ( 7 ) seems to be formulated as a minimum standard . The application to the date of the directives in force shows that the Member States have adopted different approaches and has led to approaches which or led to all of the offences , or only of the serious offences .

( 54 ) Nel valutare le due condizioni , la Commissione non è tenuta a dimostrare un &amp; apos ; incidenza effettiva degli aiuti sugli scambi tra gli Stati membri o un &amp; apos ; effettiva distorsione della concorrenza , ma deve solamente esaminare se gli aiuti siano idonei a incidere su tali scambi e a falsare la concorrenza &amp; # 91 ; 29 &amp; # 93 ; .

27 . Calls for improvements in the impact assessment systems for new regulations ; regrets that these systems are confined to enterprises in general and do not analyse the impact on small and micro enterprises , despite their importance ; regrets also the lack of transparency of systems and the impossibility of businesses to respond to impact analyses ; expects the Commission to decide on a clear and transparent method for doing them to involve the efficient participation of the relevant industrial actors ;
( 10 ) Another Community importer claimed that dried SBS and oil enriched should be considered as different products since each of these products was used by a different industry . However , several producers and SBS users have confirmed to the Commission that many Community users , especially in the footwear industry , did not distinguish between dried SBS oil and enriched . It is therefore concluded that the markets and oil enriched with oil cannot be distinguished .
347 . A state regulation which requires or provides for anticompetitive conduct or reinforces its effects infringes Articles 3 ( 1g ) , 10 ( 2 ) and 81 EC . Where a Member State delegates its power of political decision to a professional association without sufficient safeguards , i.e. without clearly indicating the objectives of public interest to be respected , without being able to give a final decision on the application of a resulting resulting resulting , it may also require responsibilities for any resulting infringement .

( 44 ) In the case of injury indicators , however , as explained in recitals 71 and 72 of the provisional Regulation , a further in-depth examination showed that the main positive development of the Community industry occurred between 1998 and 2000 . Between 2000 and the IP , almost all indicators showed only slightly increased , did not or decreased . It was during that period that the material injury suffered by the Community industry was more clear .

The Alpine region is characterised by its wealth of natural resources , including water resources , its particularly agricultural potential , historical and cultural heritage , value for quality of life and for economic and leisure activities crossing it , the Alpine region to continue to be of vital importance , but also for the population but also for the activities of which it is characterised by difficult living and production conditions for agricultural activities due to geomorphological characteristics .
- When providing the above information , the company agrees with its possible inclusion in the sample . The fact of its selection implies , for the company , replying to a questionnaire and accepting an on-the-spot investigation of their response . If the company disagrees with its possible inclusion in the sample , it will be deemed not to have cooperated in the investigation . The consequences of the absence of cooperation are set out in paragraph 8 of this notice .
Whereas egg albumin &amp; apos ; s prices are , as a matter of principle , different from the prices of eggs in the Community and on the world market ; whereas , in order to avoid distortions of competition attributable to this difference , it is necessary to charge an import duty , the amount of which is liable to offset that inequality ; whereas it appears that the most appropriate method for determining the amount of such egg duty consists of derived from the levy on eggs in shell ;
( 58 ) Therefore , the quantities guaranteed by way of the provisional anti-dumping duty imposed by the Provisional Regulation on goods manufactured by Zhejiang Sunlight Group Co . , Ltd should definitively be collected at the rate of duty definitively imposed on goods manufactured by Zhejiang Yankon Group Co . , Ltd and the TARIC additional code TARIC A241 previously attributed to Zhejiang Sunlight Group Co . , Ltd shall apply to Zhejiang Yankon Group Co . , Ltd .

( 3 ) The results of the analysis carried out by the planning and coordination group on externalisation , after a review of the situation in the Commission and , at the interinstitutional level , in various areas , emphasised the main advantages which the Commission might have in set up and which deserve particular attention , for example , to the need to ensure a coherent operation between the various offices and to define the minimum size of these offices .
( 171 ) The Commission has assessed in detail the forecasts for the restructuring plan , both in respect of orders and operating revenues by sector . For this purpose , it has verified that these elements are in line with the forecasts established for each of the markets concerned .

( 31 ) The description of the product / origin referred to in point 1 should not be accompanied by any additional justificative documents , since the indication of a reference number is considered sufficient to draw the attention of the declarant to the need for careful verification of the origin and location of all the manufacturers concerned . Furthermore , any additional document would create an unnecessary burden for the declarant on imports of DRAMs , the manufacture of which has not been subject to the countervailing duty .

( b ) the adverse effects on the interests of the requesting Party may be , and it is likely that they be , fully and appropriately investigated and , where appropriate , eliminated or appropriately corrected by applying the requested Party &amp; apos ; s standards , procedures and corrective measures . The Parties recognise that it may be appropriate to take targeted enforcement action separately when the anti-competitive activities affecting both territories justify the imposition of sanctions in the area of both jurisdictions ; and
The year 2005 marked the closure of the full third year of the new staff assessment system . However , as this is still sensitive to staff , an in-depth external evaluation of the system was launched in March 2004 .

( 47 ) Certain interested parties claimed that footwear with uppers of leather produced by the Community industry and sold on the Community market was not similar to the product concerned . In their view , this was demonstrated by differences between quality products , consumer perception , sales channels and segmentation . It was also claimed that consumers in the Community were importing the product concerned as a cheest product and that these products were not eligible for a brand premium .
The Commission , with the active participation of the Member States , will develop a forestry communication strategy which will highlight the main steps to be taken to improve communication on forestry in the Community .

Accordingly , the Commission initiated a formal investigation procedure under Article 88 ( 2 ) of the EC Treaty in respect of the abovementioned measures included in SI 1 / 2003 and N 402 / 2004 . It should be noted that certain parts of the systems , as detailed in the Commission ’ s letter to the Member State , do not constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 87 ( 1 ) of the EC Treaty and that the others are considered compatible with the common market .

Whereas , in the light of the situation which exists in the Netherlands and where the corridors are distributed on the basis of their professional knowledge in several classes , an equivalent system should be provided for nationals of the other Member States who wish to have access to one or other of the categories concerned ; whereas the most appropriate and objective criterion is that of the number of employees which the beneficiary has or has had their orders ;
2 . It is appropriate to extend the cooperation of the Contracting Parties to the Agreement to include Decision No 845 / 2004 / EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 amending Decision No 163 / 2001 / EC on the implementation of a training programme for professionals in the European audiovisual programme industry ( MEDIA-Training ) ( 2001-2005 ) &amp; # 91 ; 2 &amp; # 93 ; , as amended by OJ L 195 , 2.6.2004 , p . 1 .

( 72 ) The Community industry argued that the profit margin of 13 % on turnover would be more appropriate than 6 % used for the provisional calculation of the injury margin . According to the Community industry , the company &amp; apos ; s own funds should guarantee a return on net assets at least equal to the banks &amp; apos ; interest rates . It notes that this was the level of profits in 1996 , under conditions of fair competition .

In the present stage , and in the light of the information available , the Commission has doubts that the aid is compatible with the common market because neither the method for calculating the minimum loss that gave entitlement to the aid nor the method for calculating the aid is that the aid falls within the scope of the Community guidelines for State aid in the agricultural sector . For this reason , it cannot be that the compensation for the loss incurred was excessive .
In addition , the European Space Programme will take into account private sector stakeholders . Programme management will maximise the development of products and services that the private sector will supply to its public and commercial customers . In particular , as far as possible , risk-sharing partnerships will be considered between the public and private sectors . All interested parties will be consulted during the development and periodic review of the Programme .

Having regard to Council Directive 91 / 496 / EEC of 15 July 1991 laying down the principles governing the organization of veterinary checks on animals entering the Community from third countries and amending Directives 89 / 662 / EEC , 90 / 425 / EEC and 90 / 675 / EEC ( 3 ) , as last amended by Decision 96 / 43 / EC ( 4 ) , and in particular Article 10 thereof ,
( 108 ) This competitor considers that the compensatory measures offered are not sufficient to achieve the reduction of capacities necessary to offset the distortions of competition in the core business of MobilCom . This competitor argues that MobilCom wants to concentrate on very productive customers in the medium and higher market segments . In spite of a reduction of its customer base , it can therefore maintain its presence on the market , as the concentration in productive customers can reduce costs and market segments .
( 7 ) In addition , Council Decision 2004 / 650 / EC of 13 September 2004 amending Regulation ( EC ) No 998 / 2003 &amp; # 91 ; 2 &amp; # 93 ; added Malta to the list of countries in Part A of Annex II to that Regulation .

( 61 ) The significant increase in consumption in the free market in 2000 and 2001 is explained in part by the increased economic activity of the Community and the world market and , in part , by the application of a new system of export licences in the PRC , which triggered massive purchases ( user accumulations ) by the end of 2000 and in 2001 by miedo to the possible shortage of raw materials and the product concerned .
Whereas Regulation ( EEC ) No 357 / 79 provides that every 10 years basic surveys on areas under vines are to be carried out by the Member States concerned ; whereas , however , for technical and practical reasons , certain Member States are to consider it appropriate to link the implementation of this operation with that of the Community survey on the structure of agricultural holdings provided for in Regulation ( EEC ) No 571 / 88 ( 4 ) ;
3.1 With a view to establishing a sustainable transport system and balanced links between the various modes of transport , as set out in the White Paper on European Transport Policy for 2010 , one of the Community &amp; apos ; s objectives is to increase the market share of rail freight transport .

All beneficiaries under this scheme are in Umbria , which is not an Article 87 ( 3 ) ( a ) region according to the current regional aid map . Therefore the aid could not be justified under the regional aid guidelines . Since Italy has not been able to provide any other justification for it to be eligible for aid , the Commission has doubts that the aid could be compatible .
( 13 ) Whereas Article 5 of Council Directive 89 / 104 / EEC of 21 December 1988 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to trade marks ( 8 ) confers on the proprietor of a registered trade mark an exclusive right which includes in particular the right to prohibit all third parties from using , in the course of trade , any identical or similar sign for identical goods or services or , even for other products ;

( 15 ) The investigation covered products contained in Chapters 50 to 63 of the Combined Nomenclature and revealed that the effects of the Brazilian system are different from one product sector to another . In general terms , despite the large potential of the Brazilian market , Community textile exports to Brazil were not subject to any significant increase between 1996 and 1997 , in particular as regards exports declared to other similar markets of South America .
( 2 ) In order not to create disturbance on the market before and after 1 May 2004 , the timetable for the tranches provided for in Commission Regulation ( EC ) No 1432 / 94 ( 3 ) for 2004 should be altered and the allocation of quantities adjusted without , however , altering the overall quantities provided for in Regulation ( EC ) No 774 / 94 .
