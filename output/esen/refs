There are no magical solutions to solving this problem . Some Member States have offered fiscal incentives to so-called &amp; quot ; business angels &amp; quot ; willing to invest in small , high risk , start-ups . The exchange of good practice will be encouraged and other public policy angles explored which could possibly be brought to bear on this problem .

Whereas most Member States have hitherto endeavoured , as part of their national breeding policies , to promote the production of livestock meeting specific zootechnical standards ; whereas the existence of disparities in the implementation of these policies may hinder intra-Community trade ;
CONSIDERING , furthermore , that it is necessary to ensure the coordinated development of transport flows between and through the territories of the Contracting Parties , particularly by introducing and developing a package of coordinated measures on road and combined transport on a competitive basis through the promotion of environmentally friendly vehicles and respecting the principle of sustainable mobility ,
( 46 ) Moreover , the Commission finds that the national provisions :
( 1 ) The Auto-Oil programmes , which were initiated in 1992 to provide the analytical foundation for the setting of vehicle emission and fuel quality standards for the year 2000 and beyond , in order to achieve air quality objectives with a particular focus on reducing road transport emissions , identified the standard of motor vehicle maintenance as a key factor in the effect of traffic on air quality .
Public and market confidence in ERM II participation and the currency board remains strong , and the development of additional indicators does not reveal any major exchange rate pressures on the litas . The ratio of official reserve assets to the monetary base has well exceeded 100 percent and reached 127.5 percent in 2005 . Discretionary facilities to influence liquidity have not been used actively to a significant extent .
2 . The holder shall ensure that each source is accompanied by written information indicating that the source is identified and marked in compliance with paragraph 1 and that the markings and labels referred to in paragraph 1 remain legible .

The heart , neck , gizzard and liver , and all other parts considered as edible by the market on which the product is intended for final consumption . Livers shall be without gall bladders . The gizzard shall be without the horned membrane , and the contents of the gizzard shall have been removed . The heart may be with or without the pericardial sac . If the neck remains attached to the carcase , it is not considered as one of the giblets .
3 . Within four weeks of informing the other Member States , the Commission and EFTA Member States as required in paragraph 2 , the matter shall be brought to the attention of the Committee referred to in Article 62 ( 1 ) . The measures taken by the Member State concerned pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Article may be extended , amended or repealed in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 62 ( 2 ) .
The Commission ( Eurostat ) shall ensure a permanent dialogue with Member States ’ statistical authorities . To this end , the Commission ( Eurostat ) will carry out in all Member States regular dialogue visits , as well as possible methodological visits . The methodological visits should only be undertaken in cases where substantial risks or potential problems with the quality of the data are identified , especially as they relate to the methods , concepts and classification applied to the data , which Member States are obliged to report .
2 . Each Member State shall provide , in specific cases and under the conditions and limits laid down by national legislation , that the supervisory or administrative organ of an SE or of a participating company established in its territory is not obliged to transmit information where its nature is such that , according to objective criteria , to do so would seriously harm the functioning of the SE ( or , as the case may be , the participating company ) or its subsidiaries and establishments or would be prejudicial to them .
4 . Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3 , Member States may empower the relevant authority to impose financial penalties where appropriate on undertakings for failure to provide information in accordance with obligations imposed under Article 11 ( 1 ) ( a ) or ( b ) of this Directive or Article 9 of Directive 2002 / 19 / EC ( Access Directive ) within a reasonable period stipulated by the national regulatory authority .
The Stability and Growth Pact is based on the objective of sound government finances as a means of strengthening the conditions for price stability and for strong sustainable growth conducive to employment creation . The Stability and Growth Pact includes Council Regulation ( EC ) No 1467 / 97 &amp; # 91 ; 10 &amp; # 93 ; on speeding up and clarifying the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure set out in Article 104 in order to further the prompt correction of excessive general government deficits .

3.4 The Commission received 250 responses to its consultation . While the Committee recognises the transparency shown by the Commission in publishing all contributions received on its website , the Action Plan makes very few specific references to comments submitted and it is unclear to the reader how the responses were analysed and incorporated . Given the scale of this exercise and the interest generated across the EU , it would be unfortunate if these responses were not considered carefully and , if they were , then the Action Plan should demonstrate this .
Having regard to Council Directive 72 / 462 / EEC of 12 December 1972 on health and veterinary inspection problems upon importation of bovine animals and swine and fresh meat from third countries ( 1 ) , as last amended by Regulation ( EEC ) No 3768 / 85 ( 2 ) , and in particular Articles 4 ( 1 ) and 18 ( 1 ) thereof ,
2 . Notwithstanding paragraph 1 above , no Member State may , on grounds relating to safety-belt anchorages : - refuse , until 30 September 1986 , to grant EEC type-approval , to issue the certificate referred to in the last indent of Article 10 ( 1 ) of Directive 70 / 156 / EEC or to grant national type approval in respect of a type of motor vehicle of categories N2 and N3,
Whereas , to this effect , the rules governing the release of securities lodged at geographical destinations actually reached should be adapted , whilst ensuring the effectiveness of the measures adopted for the sale of products from intervention ; whereas , taking account of the diversity of the situations , it appears possible to provide , at a horizontal level , only for rules as to the release of the security which are limited to the aspect of export refunds ;
2 . &amp; apos ; Institutional parties not liable to account for VAT &amp; apos ; and &amp; apos ; parties exempt from VAT &amp; apos ; which appear in the second paragraph of Article 5 , Article 10 ( 3 ) ( 6 ) , and Article 11 ( 2 ) ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) of the Basic Regulation are replaced respectively by &amp; apos ; legal persons not liable to account for VAT &amp; apos ; and &amp; apos ; parties liable to account who carry out only transactions not entitling them to any deduction of VAT &amp; apos ; .
3 . Until … &amp; # 91 ; 52 &amp; # 93 ; , a Member State may maintain any existing and more stringent restrictions in relation to Annex XVII on the manufacture , placing on the market or use of a substance , provided that those restrictions have been notified according to the Treaty . The Commission shall compile and publish an inventory of these restrictions by … &amp; # 91 ; 62 &amp; # 93 ; .
( 69 ) All parties concerned were informed of the essential facts on the basis of which it was intended to recommend the amendment of the existing measures and were given an opportunity to comment . Comments were received and taken into consideration where appropriate . All parties concerned were also granted a period to make representations subsequent to disclosure .
2 . When the quantities corresponding to a declaration of entry into storage have been exported , the operator shall have the right to payment of the refund on those quantities , provided that the other conditions of the Community rules on exports with a refund , in particular those laid down in Article 6 of Regulation ( EEC ) No 1964 / 82 , in Article 21 and in Title IV of Regulation ( EC ) No 800 / 1999 , have been met .
3.17 The Committee agrees with the statement in the text of the proposal that its European added value is directly linked to the nature of the actions , i.e. promoting collaboration between States in order to allow young people to move between different countries . Countries could not achieve this by themselves . It is therefore paramount that all the participating countries take into consideration the provisions of Article 6 ( 5 ) of the proposal , and take every possible step to eliminate any remaining obstacles to mobility .
3 . In particular , the competent authorities shall have the power to take the necessary action to apply with due dispatch appropriate measures such as those mentioned in paragraph 1 , ( b ) to ( f ) , in the case of products posing a serious risk . These circumstances shall be determined by the Member States , assessing each individual case on its merits , taking into account the guidelines referred to in point 8 of Annex II .
The one percent objective remains an objective to be reached but a number of legal instruments have been put into place ; agreements on objectives have been signed with various economic sectors ; a wider discussion has been initiated by the Commission or at the Council &amp; apos ; s request . The Kyoto agreements have come into effect ; objectives have been outlined for the development of renewable energy . The objective to reduce the energy intensity will probably not be realised straight away , but will rather take place sector by sector , on a gradual basis .
The detection test requires samples of counterfeit coins for all denominations concerned , with a definition also covering materials used for producing coin-like objects and non-euro coins . For that purpose , a number of representative families should be used , coming from the stocks deposited with the Coin National Analysis Centres ( CNACs ) or the European Technical and Scientific Centre ( ETSC ) . The ETSC , in collaboration with the CNACs defines and updates these families .
( 55 ) In the light of the provisions of recitals 29 to 31 above , the Commission notes that all the requirements set out in recitals 53 and 54 are met , provided that the rates of aid indicated in the draft order express a gross subsidy equivalent and that the aid continues to include an incentive element and is not retrospective , in other words , is granted in respect of work undertaken before an application has been properly submitted .
having regard to Commission Regulation ( EC , Euratom ) No 2343 / 2002 of 19 November 2002 on the framework Financial Regulation for the bodies referred to in Article 185 of Council Regulation ( EC , Euratom ) No 1605 / 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities &amp; # 91 ; 4 &amp; # 93 ; , and in particular Article 94 thereof ,
COMMISSION DIRECTIVE 95 / 44 / EC of 26 July 1995 establishing the conditions under which certain harmful organisms , plants , plant products and other objects listed in Annexes I to V to Council Directive 77 / 93 / EEC may be introduced into or moved within the Community or certain protected zones thereof , for trial or scientific purposes and for work on varietal selections
( 4 ) The commercial operation of trains throughout the trans-European rail network requires in particular excellent compatibility between the characteristics of the infrastructure and those of the rolling stock , as well as efficient interconnection of the information and communication systems of the different infrastructure managers and operators . Performance levels , safety , quality of service and cost depend upon such compatibility and interconnection , as does , in particular , the interoperability of the trans-European conventional rail system .
3 . On the basis of the mandate the EUEB shall draft the eco-label criteria in respect of the product group and the assessment and verification requirements related to those criteria , as outlined in Article 4 and Annex IV , by taking into account the results of feasibility and market studies , life cycle considerations and the improvement analysis referred to in Annex II .
The applicants allege that the existing measure on imports of the product under review from Garware Polyester Ltd at its present level is no longer sufficient to counteract the subsidisation which is causing injury . The applicants have provided sufficient evidence in accordance with Article 19 ( 2 ) of the basic Regulation that the subsidy amount has increased well above the 3,8 % of the definitive countervailing duty which is currently applicable for Garware Polyester Ltd .
( 23 ) For certain companies subject to the review , the model types sold under a particular product grouping did not change significantly since the acceptance of the undertakings . However , the likely increase in the number of product groupings due to further developments in the product groupings , as mentioned in recital ( 22 ) above , could arise at any future stage and in the case of any exporting producer .
Becoming a Member State of the European Union , Latvia unilaterally introduced visa-free regime for the citizens of the Federative Republic of Brazil in accordance with EU Council Regulation ( EC ) No 539 / 2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement .
( 2 ) Commission Decisions 2004 / 40 / EC ( 4 ) , 2004 / 39 / EC ( 5 ) , 2004 / 37 / EC ( 6 ) and 2004 / 38 / EC ( 7 ) set specific import conditions for fishery products originating in Guyana , Kenya , Serbia and Montenegro and Egypt , respectively . These countries should therefore be added to the list in part I of the Annex to Decision 97 / 296 / EC .
15 . Support and give priority , within the framework of the Community Public Health Programme &amp; # 91 ; 7 &amp; # 93 ; and successor programmes , to establish a Community-wide injury surveillance system collecting injury data provided by the Member States on the basis of their national injury surveillance systems and make the information contained in the database easily accessible to all stakeholders ;
( 62 ) The address of the non-cooperating exporting producer indicates that its facilities are located in the Cakung export processing zone , which is an area designated as % quot % Nusantara bonded zone % quot % . The company confirmed this information . Companies located in such a zone are eligible for certain benefits that are normally not available to companies located outside these zones , notably an exemption from import duty on goods to be used in the production of exported finished products .
- the additional wording in Article 7 ( 1 ) gives the impression that the conversion rate specified in contracts or grant agreements is to be used by authorising officers in preference to the official rate , whereas paragraph 3 of point 2.1 of the explanatory memorandum explains that the contractual rate is to be used for conversion by contractors and beneficiaries only ,
( g ) personal and household effects imported for use by natural persons , other than those recruited locally , engaged in carrying out the tasks defined in a service contract , as well as members of their families , shall be exempt from customs or import duties , taxes and other fiscal charges having equivalent effect , within the limit of the national legislation in force in the beneficiary OCT .
( a ) ‘ food additive ’ shall mean any substance not normally consumed as a food in itself and not normally used as a characteristic ingredient of food , whether or not it has nutritive value , the intentional addition of which to food for a technological purpose in the manufacture , processing , preparation , treatment , packaging , transport or storage of such food results , or may be reasonably expected to result , in it or its by-products becoming directly or indirectly a component of such foods ;
Whereas Article 13 of the Regulation provides for a further reduction in the customs duty applicable to rice originating in the ACP countries ; whereas that reduction is subject to the levying by the exporting ACP country of an export charge equal to the amount of the reduction in the customs duty ; whereas , pursuant to Article 34 of that Regulation , the reduction is to apply from 1 January 1996 ;
3.1 The EESC has been following closely developments regarding this issue since the 1980s and adopted two Opinions in 1982 &amp; # 91 ; 11 &amp; # 93 ; and in 1985 &amp; # 91 ; 12 &amp; # 93 ; the gist of which was given a follow-up in Regulation 4056 / 86 . Hence , it welcomes the White Paper and the brainstorming exercise launched by the Commission and hopes to contribute significantly towards arriving at a meaningful competition regime in the EU and worldwide .

- to reduce inconsistencies in anti-money laundering requirements and practices both within the EU ( in terms of both different Member States and different parts of the regulated sector or other sectors vulnerable to money laundering ) and between it and third countries ( this necessarily implies a reduction of Member State options under the Directive for their own discretionary variations ) ; and
1 . Member States shall submit to the Commission a statistical summary showing stocks existing at the end of each month , drawn up in accordance with Article 5 ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) and Article 6 and specifying the number of days of average consumption in the preceding calendar year which those stocks represent . This summary shall be submitted at the latest by the 25th day of the second month after the month to be reported .
In order to enable the Commission to decide whether sampling is necessary and , if so , to select a sample , all exporters / producers , or representatives acting on their behalf , are hereby requested to make themselves known by contacting the Commission and providing the following information on their company or companies within the time limit set in point 6 ( b ) ( i ) and in the format indicated in point 7 :
Objective : Aid would be granted towards the costs of vaccinations of hens against Newcastle disease administered in accordance with Order ( Bekendtgørelse ) No 1022 of 21.10.2004 of the Danish Food Office ( Fødevarestyrelsen ) .

The notified measure concerns the introduction of digital terrestrial television ( &amp; quot ; DVB-T &amp; quot ; ) in the German Land of Bavaria where it was launched in Munich and Nuremberg on 30 May 2005 . The switchover project has been led by the Bavarian media authority Bayerische Landeszentrale für neue Medien ( &amp; quot ; BLM &amp; quot ; ) .
( 24 ) The investigation has shown that the quantities exported from the PRC to the Community for inward processing have increased significantly from 2000 to the IP ( see recital ( 33 ) below ) . If the measures were repealed , it can be expected that exports from the PRC would increase significantly also outside inward processing arrangements , given the significant price difference between the Chinese and the EC producer ’ s furfuraldehyde and the unused capacity explained in recital ( 26 ) below .
The first Part of the European consensus on development sets out common objectives and principles for development cooperation . It reaffirms EU commitment to poverty eradication , ownership , partnership , delivering more and better aid and promoting policy coherence for development . It will guide Community and Member State development cooperation activities in all developing countries &amp; # 91 ; 4 &amp; # 93 ; , in a spirit of complementarity .
&amp; # 91 ; 1 &amp; # 93 ; The consultation was launched by the Commission following adoption of the Communication ‘ Towards a Thematic Strategy on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides ’ - COM ( 2002 ) 349 . All steps of the consultation and the relevant documents are available at : http : / / europa.eu.int / comm / environment / ppps / home.htm
All Member States ( except MT and UK ) have explicitly adopted the single form and provided for several possible means of transmission . A difficulty in this respect is that the Framework Decision does not provide for making an Interpol alert equivalent to a request for provisional arrest , unlike an SIS alert ( Article 9 ( 3 ) ) . Pending the application of the second Schengen Information System ( SIS II ) , each Member State could remedy this with a national provision .
3.1.4 &amp; quot ; Serious crime &amp; quot ; ( defined to include &amp; quot ; at least &amp; quot ; the activities listed in Article 3 ( 7 ) ) appears to be framed as a minimum standard . Implementation to date of the existing directives shows that Member States have taken different approaches resulting in regimes either encompassing all crimes , or alternatively encompassing only serious crimes .
( m ) &amp; apos ; period for discharge &amp; apos ; means the time by which the goods or products must have been assigned a new permitted customs-approved treatment or use including , as the case may be , in order to claim repayment of import duties after inward processing ( drawback system ) , or in order to obtain total or partial relief from import duties upon release for free circulation after outward processing .
5 . Each year , before 15 October and in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 42 , the list of programmesr qualifying for a financial contribution from the Community for the following year shall be drawn up and the proposed rate and amount of the contribution for each programme shall be determined . This Decision shall also take account of the prospects for financing the current programmes which are to be covered as multiannual programmes .
( 54 ) Nel valutare le due condizioni , la Commissione non è tenuta a dimostrare un &amp; apos ; incidenza effettiva degli aiuti sugli scambi tra gli Stati membri o un &amp; apos ; effettiva distorsione della concorrenza , ma deve solamente esaminare se gli aiuti siano idonei a incidere su tali scambi e a falsare la concorrenza &amp; # 91 ; 29 &amp; # 93 ; . Allorché un aiuto finanziario concesso da uno Stato membro rafforza la posizione di un &amp; apos ; impresa nei confronti di altre imprese concorrenti negli scambi intracomunitari , questi sono da considerarsi influenzati dall &amp; apos ; aiuto .
( 2 ) For the purposes of Article 5 ( 4 ) of the Agreement on Agriculture &amp; # 91 ; 4 &amp; # 93 ; concluded during the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations and in the light of the latest data available for 2002 , 2003 and 2004 , the trigger levels for additional duties on cucumbers , artichokes , clementines , mandarins and oranges should be adjusted .

27 . Calls for the procedure used for assessing the impact of new regulatory measures to be improved ; regrets the fact that these procedures are limited to enterprises in general and do not analyse the impact on small and micro-enterprises despite their importance ; regrets also the lack of transparency in these procedures and the fact that it is impossible for the organisations representing enterprises to respond to the impact analyses ; expects the Commission to adopt a clear and transparent method for conducting these procedures that includes the efficient involvement of the relevant industrial actors ;
( 10 ) Another Community importer claimed that dry and oil-extended SBS should be considered as two different products , arguing that dry and oil-extended SBS are used by different industries . However , different producers and users of SBS confirmed to the Commission that many Community users , especially in the footwear industry , do not differentiate dry and oil-extended SBS . It is therefore concluded that the markets of dry and oil-extended SBS cannot be distinguished .
323 . State regulation which imposes or favours anticompetitive conduct or reinforces its effects , infringes Articles 3 ( 1 ) ( g ) , 10 ( 2 ) and 81 EC . Where a State delegates its policy-making power to a professional association without sufficient safeguards - that is , without clearly indicating the public interest objectives to be respected , without retaining the power to take the decisions of last resort and without monitoring implementation - the Member State can also be held liable for any resulting infringement .
( 1 ) Council Regulation ( EC , EURATOM ) No 58 / 97 of 20 December 1996 concerning structural business statistics &amp; # 91 ; 3 &amp; # 93 ; has been substantially amended several times &amp; # 91 ; 4 &amp; # 93 ; . Since further amendments are to be made , it should be recast in the interests of clarity .
2 . With regards to the parcels occupied partially by olive trees and partially by other crops covered by the single payment scheme , including set-aside areas , the calculation method to be used to determine the surface occupied by olive trees shall be the method referred to in paragraph 1 . The surface of the part of the area planted with other crops covered by the single payment scheme is determined in accordance with the integrated system provided for in Title II , Chapter 4 of Regulation ( CE ) No 1782 / 2003 .
( i ) &amp; quot ; energy service company &amp; quot ; ( ESCO ) : a natural or legal person that delivers energy services and / or other energy efficiency improvement measures in a user &amp; apos ; s facility or premises , and accepts some degree of financial risk in so doing . The payment for the services delivered is based ( either wholly or in part ) on the achievement of energy efficiency improvements and on the meeting of the other agreed performance criteria ;
( 44 ) However for the injury indicators , and as outlined in recitals 71 and 72 of the provisional Regulation , a closer examination showed that the main positive developments for the Community industry took place between 1998 and 2000 . Between 2000 and the IP , nearly all indicators either rose only slightly , remained stagnant , or indeed fell . It is during this period that the material injury suffered by the Community industry is most apparent .
( 1 ) The Alpine region is characterised by its wealth of natural resources , including water resources , agricultural potential , historical and cultural heritage , value for quality of life and for economic and leisure activities not only for the local , but also for other populations . However , the Alpine region is also characterised by difficult living and production conditions for farming activities due to geomorphological and climatic conditions .
- by providing the above information , the company agrees to its possible inclusion in the sample . If the company is chosen to be part of the sample , this will imply replying to a questionnaire and accepting an on-the-spot investigation of its response . If the company indicates that it does not agree to its possible inclusion in the sample , it will be deemed to not have cooperated in the investigation . The consequences of non-cooperation are set out in point 8 below .
Whereas ovalbumin prices normally follow egg prices , which are different in the Community and on the world market ; whereas in order to prevent distortions of competition resulting from this difference it is necessary to levy an import duty sufficient to offset this difference ; whereas it seems that the most appropriate method for determining the amount of this duty would be to derive it from the levy on eggs in shell ;
( 58 ) Therefore the amounts secured by way of the provisional anti-dumping duty imposed by the provisional Regulation in respect of goods manufactured by Zhejiang Sunlight Group Co . , Ltd should be definitively collected at the rate of the duty definitively imposed on goods manufactured by Zhejiang Yankon Group Co . , Ltd , and the TARIC additional code A241 previously attributed to Zhejiang Sunlight Group Co . , Ltd , shall apply to Zhejiang Yankon Group Co . , Ltd ,

The obligation and the modalities for providing information pursuant to Directive 90 / 496 / EEC where a nutrition claim is made shall apply , mutatis mutandis , where a health claim is made , with the exception of generic advertising . However , the information to be provided shall consist of information in Group 2 as defined in Article 4 ( 1 ) of Directive 90 / 496 / EEC .
1.5 feels that particular attention must be paid to the new Member States in order to meet shared and prospective health-care challenges . Clear priority should be given to supporting the new Member States in developing health measures and improving people &amp; apos ; s state of health , so as to reduce the discrepancies and imbalances that exist on the health front within the Union , in order , gradually , to come within range of the top EU benchmark .
This Regulation , under the conditions laid down in the Regulations relating to each of the individual products , shall apply to the markets in cereals , pigmeat , eggs and poultrymeat from 1 July 1962 , to the market in milk and milk products from 1 November 1962 , and where necessary , to other markets from dates to be determined by the Council .
The twin-track approach responds to Serbia and Montenegro ’ s complex institutional structure . In its conclusions of 11 October 2004 , the Council expressed “ its support for the twin-track approach , which would imply a single Stabilisation and Association Agreement with distinct negotiations with the Republics on trade , economic and possibly on other relevant sectoral policies . The Council reaffirmed its commitment to a strengthened State Union of Serbia and Montenegro based on the Constitutional Charter . ”
( 20 ) This Directive will encourage the use of more energy-efficient technologies , including combined heat and power technology , producing less emissions per unit of output , while the future directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the promotion of cogeneration based on useful heat demand in the internal energy market will specifically promote combined heat and power technology .
( 1 ) Council Regulation ( EC ) No 1258 / 1999 of 17 May 1999 on the financing of the common agricultural policy ( 3 ) provides that the specific veterinary actions defined in Decision 90 / 424 / EEC ( 4 ) would be financed as from 1 January 2000 by the Guarantee Section of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund ( EAGGF ) in order to achieve the objectives set out in Article 33 ( 1 ) of the Treaty .
( 35 ) The comparison was made at the level of prices to wholesalers ( thus excluding sales to retailers and the advertising sector ) . Moreover , the price comparison was made for naked lighters ( including , however , the lighters the exporter presented as % quot % wrapped % quot % ) as the exporter had not exported any printed or sleeved lighters during the investigation period .
On 15 february 2006 , the Commission decided not to oppose the above notified concentration and to declare it compatible with the common market . This decision is based on Article 6 ( 1 ) ( b ) of Council Regulation ( EC ) No 139 / 2004 . The full text of the decision is available only in French and will be made public after it is cleared of any business secrets it may contain . It will be available :
26 . Stresses that rebuilding the affected areas must focus on improving the situation of the surviving inhabitants by aiming to reduce poverty as well as future vulnerability to tsunami ; insists that all funds given for reconstruction must be subject to full transparency and accountability before their disbursement ; calls on the governments concerned to develop National Reconstruction Plans which include mechanisms for a broad spectrum of civil society to participate in their design and implementation ;
9 . This Framework Decision on requests for information extracted from criminal records should not prejudge the possibility of judicial authorities ’ transmitting directly information from criminal records pursuant to Article 6 ( 1 ) of the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between the Member States of the European Union , set up by Council Decision of 29 May 2000 &amp; # 91 ; 8 &amp; # 93 ; .
However , it is also important to overcome the limitations that currently restrict the information potential of certain indicators . To this end , efforts need to be made during a transition period for the conceptual and methodological improvement of these indicators and for the collection of the necessary data or better access to existing data , in particular at regional level . In this respect , the full involvement and commitment of the Member States , which are ultimately responsible for data collection , is necessary .
( 72 ) The Thai exporting producers and an importers association submitted comments on the provisional causation analysis with regard to certain factors which are set out below . In the absence of any other comments , the findings set out in the provisional Regulation concerning the effect of dumped imports ( recital 152 of the provisional Regulation ) , the impact of imports from other third countries ( recitals 153 to 159 of the provisional Regulation ) and the development of consumption on the Community market ( recital 160 of the provisional Regulation ) are hereby confirmed .
3.3.2 That is why the EESC opinion highlights , among other things , the issue of work and employment in the fields of culture and the arts , and of a culture-based economy , and it is in these areas that the Committee would like to see better use being made of the work of the Dublin Foundation . It would be useful to analyse how the forms assumed by cultural and artistic work are given shape by a more creative assessment of work as a whole and reflect the knowledge-based economy .
1 . Community financial instruments shall be operated with the aim of facilitating access to finance for SMEs in certain phases of their life cycle : seed , start-up , expansion and business transfer .

Whereas , in its White Paper on the Future Development of the Common Transport Policy and its communication for an action programme on road safety , the Commission considers that , bearing in mind the significant differences in the levels of road safety in different Member States , a major priority in this area should be to promote the exchange of information and experience by the setting up of a Community database ;
- consider granting licences , on a case-by-case basis and under the conditions set forth in the WTO Arrangement initialled by Vietnam and the European Community on 9 October 2004 , for the European Community ’ s operators to establish 100 % European Community – owned enterprises in Vietnam to provide computer services , construction services , engineering , integrated engineering , architectural services and urban planning services without restrictions on the customers to whom these services are provided ,
In case of doubt , the Member States may demand a copy of the document certifying the origin of the materials used in Nepal under this derogation . Such a demand may be made at the time of entry into free circulation of the goods benefiting from the provisions of this Regulation , or within the framework of the administrative cooperation for which provision is made in Article 94 of Regulation ( EEC ) No 2454 / 93 .
1.4 By means of this new proposal for a Regulation , &amp; # 91 ; 2 &amp; # 93 ; the European Commission wishes to create a Community Fisheries Control Agency ( hereafter the Agency ) as the Community &amp; apos ; s specialised technical body for ensuring the uniform and effective application of the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy by Member States , for organising operational coordination between Member States regarding fisheries monitoring and inspection and for promoting cooperation between them .
( 8 ) The National Electric System is organised in two co-existing systems , the public electricity system or &amp; quot ; bound system &amp; quot ; ( Sistema Eléctrico de Serviço Público , SEP ) and the independent electricity system ( Sistema Eléctrico Independente , SEI ) . The national transmission grid is used for both systems and is exploited under a concession regime by Rede Eléctrica National ( REN ) .
( 2 ) Commission Directive 2004 / 78 / EC of 29 April 2004 amending Directive 2001 / 56 / EC of the European Parliament and of the Council relating to heating systems for motor vehicles and their trailers and Council Directive 70 / 156 / EEC for the purposes of adapting to technical progress &amp; # 91 ; 2 &amp; # 93 ; , as corrected by OJ L 231 , 30.6.2004 , p . 69 , is to be incorporated into the Agreement ,
Whereas the Environment Committee of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) has forwarded to the Council of that Organization a draft Decision / recommandation recommending inter alia the ratification and rapid application of the Basle Convention on the control of transboundary movements of hazardous wastes and their disposal , signed on 22 March 1989 by some of the Member States of the OECD , as well as the Community ;
( 3 ) The results of the analysis undertaken by the Planning and Coordination Group on Externalisation , after taking stock of the situation in the Commission and at inter-institutional level across a number of areas , highlight the main advantages that the creation of Commission offices could bring and the areas where special attention is needed , such as , for example , the need to ensure that operations at the various sites are consistent and to define the minimum critical size of each office .
( 171 ) The Commission assessed in detail the forecasts resulting from the restructuring plan , both for orders and for operating revenue per sector . It checked that these aspects are in line with the forecasts established for each of the relevant markets . The Commission considers that the forecasts for orders are in general realistic and that the forecasts for market shares and industrial growth are sufficiently prudent . Two sectors , however , form an exception : Power Turbo-Systems and Marine .
( e ) the name and business address of the representative , other than a representative falling within the first sentence of Article 88 ( 3 ) of the Regulation ; where there is more than one representative , only the name and business address of the first named representative , followed by the words and others , shall be recorded ; where an association of representatives is appointed , only the name and address of the association shall be recorded ;
Whereas disparity between the laws , regulations and administrative provisions relating to the classification , packaging and labelling of dangerous substances and to the notification of new substances in the Member States may lead to barriers to trade between Member States and create unequal conditions of competition ; whereas the disparity between these measures in the Member States has a direct impact on the functioning of the internal market and does not guarantee the same level of protection of public health and the environment ;
( 9 ) The request alleged that producers of pocket flint lighters in China have added a refill valve to the basic disposable flint lighter , in order for it to be classified as a refillable flint lighter for customs purposes and thereby fall under a different CN code which is not subject to the existing measures . It was further alleged that these lighters ( hereinafter referred to as &amp; apos ; disposable , refillable flint lighters` ) are not , in practice , sold or used as refillable .

&amp; apos ; impartiality` is an objective and independent manner of producing Community statistics , free from any pressure from political or other interest groups , particularly as regards the selection of techniques , definitions and methodologies best suited to the attainment of the objectives as set out . It implies the availability of statistics , with a minimum delay , to all users ( Community institutions , governments , social and economic operators , academic circles and the public in general ) ;
2 . While , in the current state of Community law , there is nothing which precludes the Member States from defining , in compliance with Community law , the conditions of the right to vote and to stand as a candidate in elections to the European Parliament by reference to the criterion of residence in the territory in which the elections are held , the principle of equal treatment prevents , however , the criteria chosen from resulting in the different treatment of nationals who are in comparable situations , unless that difference in treatment is objectively justified .
The applicant shall be informed in writing within one month whether his application is granted or whether the intention is to refuse access . In the latter case , the applicant shall be informed of the reasons for this intention . He shall also be informed that he has one month in which to apply to the Management Board chairperson for review of the intention to refuse access failing which he will be deemed to have withdrawn his application .
2 . Terminal equipment covered by this Decision shall comply with the common technical Regulation referred to in paragraph 1 , shall meet the essential requirements referred to in Article 5 ( a ) and ( b ) of Directive 98 / 13 / EC , and shall meet the requirements of any other applicable Directives , in particular Council Directives 73 / 23 / EEC ( 2 ) and 89 / 336 / EEC ( 3 ) .
Whereas the principle underlying this Directive should be that any material or article intended to come into contact or which is intentionally in contact either directly or indirectly with foodstuffs , must be sufficiently stable not to transfer substances to the foodstuffs in quantities which could endanger human health or bring about an unacceptable change in the composition of the foodstuffs or a deterioration in the organoleptic properties thereof ;
( 68 ) In the light of the findings at recitals 59 to 67 , it is concluded that the expiry of the measures on these imports is likely to lead to a recurrence of injury as defined by the various indicators used in Article 3 ( 5 ) of the basic Regulation . In reaching this conclusion , the Commission has taken into account the fact that the Community market for REWS is susceptible to price pressure as it is dominated by large users .
( 1 ) Commission Decision 92 / 452 / EEC of 30 July 1992 establishing lists of embryo collection teams and embryo production teams approved in third countries for export of bovine embryos to the Community &amp; # 91 ; 2 &amp; # 93 ; provides that Member States are only to import embryos from third countries where they have been collected , processed and stored by embryo collection teams listed in that Decision .
2 . The competent authorities , acting in accordance with this Regulation , may refuse to grant an export authorisation and may annul , suspend , modify or revoke an export authorisation which they have already granted . Where they refuse , annul , suspend , substantially limit or revoke an authorisation , they shall inform the competent authorities of the other Member States and the Commission thereof and exchange the relevant information with the other Member States and the Commission , while complying with the provisions of Article 15 ( 3 ) concerning the confidentiality of such information .
( 10 ) In order to ensure a prompt correction of excessive deficits , it is necessary for Member States that are in a situation of excessive deficit to take effective action and to achieve an annual minimum fiscal improvement in their cyclically adjusted balance , net of one-off and temporary measures . As a benchmark , countries in excessive deficit will be required to achieve an annual minimum fiscal effort in cyclically adjusted terms , net of one-off and temporary measures .
In order to enable the Commission to decide whether sampling is necessary and , if so , to select a sample , all exporters / producers , or representatives acting on their behalf , are hereby requested to make themselves known by contacting the Commission and providing the following information on their company or companies within the time limit set in point 6 ( b ) ( i ) and in the format indicated in point 7 :
3.5 The EYPD 2003 decision foresaw the participation of EFTA / EEA countries , the associated countries of Central and Eastern Europe , Cyprus , Malta , and Turkey , most of them either having become members of the EU , or being candidates for accession . However , the Communication gives no information on the activities organised in those countries , regardless of whether or not a specific agreement has been signed with the European Commission .
Whereas the technical progress made in the construction of positive-ignition engines since Council Directive 70 / 220 / EEC laid down the permissible limits for carbon monoxide and unburnt hydrocarbon emissions from these engines , which limits were made more stringent by Council Directive 74 / 290 / EEC of 28 May 1974 ( 4 ) , also enables permissible limits to be laid down for nitrogen oxide emissions ;
3 . In order for an SE to be registered in a Member State which has made use of the option referred to in Article 7 ( 3 ) of Directive 2001 / 86 / EC , either an agreement pursuant to Article 4 of the Directive must have been concluded on the arrangements for employee involvement , including participation , or none of the participating companies must have been governed by participation rules prior to the registration of the SE .

8.4 Consumers need to be provided with better education on all aspects of the food market and the long term consequences of their demands . Large out-of-town superstores promoting low food prices are often of little value to low income families when they are unable to get suitable transport to the store to purchase low priced food products . 8.5 Issues such as obesity and sustainable consumption are essential matters for consumers . Retailers need to adopt policy positions on these matters .
( 6 ) ICCAT has recommended the Contracting Parties to take appropriate measures to prohibit imports of Atlantic bigeye tuna products originating in Belize , Cambodia , Equatorial Guinea , Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and Honduras . These measures will be lifted as soon as it is established that the countries in question have brought their fishing practices into line with ICCAT &amp; apos ; s measures . These measures must be implemented by the Community , which has sole competence in this matter .

5 . Acknowledges that , in keeping with its request , emergency ordinances have been used only in the &amp; quot ; exceptional circumstances &amp; quot ; provided for in the Romanian Constitution , but regrets that , in reality , reliance on this type of practice has not decreased ; repeats its call for the Romanian Government to refrain from resorting to emergency ordinances and to employ ordinary legislative procedures ; calls for a clearer and more explicit definition of what is meant by &amp; quot ; exceptional circumstances &amp; quot ; in the context of emergency ordinances ;
( 31 ) The product / origin description falling under number 1 should not be accompanied by any additional supporting evidence . Indeed , the indication of a reference number , as such , is considered as sufficient to raise the attention of the declarant to the need to check carefully the origin and the location of all manufacturers involved . Moreover , any additional document would put an undue burden on the declarant in case of imports of DRAMs in the manufacture of which no company subject to the countervailing duty has intervened .
( 2 ) At several summit meetings , including those held in Stockholm in March 2001 , Barcelona in March 2002 and Brussels in March 2003 and 2004 , the European Council , recognising the importance of a properly functioning internal market &amp; # 91 ; 1 &amp; # 93 ; for the competitiveness of the European economy , has repeatedly urged Member States to accord high priority to the transposition into national law of Directives affecting the internal market .
Whereas such confirmation is necessary in order to pursue the detailed examination of the dossier as well as in order to open to the Member States the possibility of granting provisional authorization for plant protection products containing this active substance in due respect of the conditions laid down in Article 8 ( 1 ) of the Directive , and in particular the condition to make a detailed assessment of the active substance and the plant protection product with regard to the requirements of the Directive ;
Whereas the establishment and functioning of the internal market involve the elimination of technical barriers to the transfer of ships between Member States &amp; apos ; national registers ; whereas measures to facilitate the transfer of ships within the Community are also required to free European shipowners from the costs and administrative procedures involved in a change of register within the Community and also to improve thereby the operating conditions and competitive position of Community shipping ;
- by providing the above information , the company agrees to its possible inclusion in the sample . If the company is chosen to be part of the sample , this will imply replying to a questionnaire and accepting an on-the-spot investigation of its response . If the company indicates that it does not agree to its possible inclusion in the sample , it will be deemed to not have co-operated in the investigation . The consequences of non-cooperation are set out in point 8 below .
( b ) the adverse effects on the interests of the Requesting Party can be and are likely to be fully and adequately investigated and , as appropriate , eliminated or adequately remedied pursuant to the laws , procedures , and available remedies of the Requested Party . The Parties recognise that it may be appropriate to pursue separate enforcement activities where anti-competitive activities affecting both territories justify the imposition of penalties within both jurisdictions ; and
2005 marked the completion of the third full exercise of the new staff appraisal system . However , since this remains a sensitive issue for staff , an in-depth external evaluation of the system was launched in March 2004 . This evaluation was conducted with a view to improving , in particular , the link between merit and promotion and the differentiation of career progress and also to addressing questions of transparency .
( b ) Where NCBs know or have sufficient reason to believe that a criminal offence has been committed they shall refuse to exchange the mutilated or damaged euro banknotes and shall withhold them , against acknowledgement of receipt , as evidence to be presented to the competent authorities to initiate or to support an ongoing criminal investigation .

1 ) that Decision C ( 2005 ) 2756 of 20 July 2005 contains an inadequate statement of reasons in relation to Article 253 of the Treaty and that the Commission has misused its powers by distorting the facts in that the contested decision makes an overall adjustment to the aid granted for tobacco production in the marketing year 2000 without providing an appropriately detailed statement of reasons as to the rules allegedly infringed or indeed any factual grounds that could justify the decision ;
( 47 ) Certain interested parties argued that footwear with uppers of leather produced by the Community industry and sold on the Community market was not similar to the product concerned . They claimed that this is evidenced in particular by differences between products in terms of quality , consumer perceptions , channels of sales and segmentation . It was further claimed that the consumers in the Community usually perceive the product concerned as being a cheaper product and that those products do not benefit from any brand premium .
The Commission , with active participation by the Member States , will develop a communication strategy on forestry . This will outline the main steps to be taken to improve communication on forestry in the Community . Exchanges of experience between the Member States will take place in the context of the preparation of the strategy . The feasibility of individual communication measures in the context of future international events on forests &amp; # 91 ; 31 &amp; # 93 ; will also be explored .
2 . However , notwithstanding paragraph 1 , it may be decided that intervention agencies are to make unprocessed sugar held by them available , for human consumption on the internal market of the Community , to charitable organisations - recognised by the Member State concerned or by the Commission in cases where a Member State has not recognised any such organisations - at a price which is lower than the intervention price , or free of charge , for free distribution as part of individual emergency aid operations .

( 5 ) The Commission officially advised the applicant Community producers , the exporters and exporting producers in China , importers / traders , users and suppliers , which were known to be concerned , of the initiation of the review . The Commission sent questionnaires to all these parties and to those who made themselves known within the time limit set in the Notice of initiation . The Commission also gave the parties directly concerned the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing .
The Commission initiates a formal investigation procedure in line with Article 88 ( 2 ) of the EC Treaty with respect to the above measures of the schemes SI 1 / 2003 and N 402 / 2004 . It should be noted that certain parts of the schemes , as detailed in the Commission &amp; apos ; s letter to the Member State , do not constitute State aid in meaning of Article 87 ( 1 ) of the EC Treaty , while others are considered to be compatible with the common market .
For the 1995 accounting year ( a period of 12 consecutive months beginning between 1 January and 1 July 1995 ) and for subsequent accounting years , the threshold of economic size as referred to in Article 4 of Regulation 79 / 65 / EEC in ESU within the meaning of Annex III to Commission Decision 85 / 377 / EEC ( * ) shall be as follows :

The Greek Authorities submitted in February 2005 to the Commission and to the Council a report on the implementation of Regulation ( EC ) No 1295 / 2003 &amp; # 91 ; 3 &amp; # 93 ; . The report stressed the successful implementation of the derogation system and confirmed that the provisions of the Regulation offered an effective and flexible visa regime adequate for allowing Greece , as a Schengen Member State to respect its obligation under the Olympic Charter without diminishing the level of security in the common area without internal borders .
Whereas Decisions 87 / 593 / EEC , 87 / 594 / EEC and 87 / 595 / EEC should be adopted on the sole legal basis of Article 113 ; whereas Article 113 should therefore be inserted as the legal basis of Decision 87 / 593 / EEC ; whereas Articles 28 and 235 should be removed as legal bases of the three Decisions ; whereas Article 43 should be removed as a legal basis of Decisions 87 / 593 / EEC and 87 / 594 / EEC ,
On 12 January 2006 , the Commission decided not to oppose the above notified concentration and to declare it compatible with the common market . This decision is based on Article 6 ( 1 ) ( b ) of Council Regulation ( EC ) No 139 / 2004 . The full text of the decision is available only in English and will be made public after it is cleared of any business secrets it may contain . It will be available :
2.9 Lastly , certain categories of vehicle are specifically exempted from the proposal : special purpose vehicles ( ambulances , motor caravans , etc . ) ; vehicles produced in small series ( where not more than 500 are put into service each year in each Member State ) ; and light-duty trucks that are manufactured in several stages ( i.e. at the design stage the manufacturer does not know what type of bodywork will be added to the frame ) .
The combination of the region &amp; apos ; s unique edaphological and climatic conditions , the perfect harmony between the crop and nature , the area &amp; apos ; s population patterns , advanced social and economical development and a culture deeply rooted in olive cultivation have resulted in the production of the PDO % quot % Aceite Monterrubio % quot % . Critics and consumers alike appreciate this distinctive extra virgin olive oil .
3.5 The budget for the actions set out in the programme is EUR 915 m. over seven years . This sum comes close to the EUR 1 bn. that the Committee deemed necessary for the YOUTH programme for the period 2000-2006 . In effect , the budget is being increased from the EUR 657 m. or so earmarked for the YOUTH programme to EUR 915 m. for the Youth in Action programme .

4.8.1 Whilst the threshold for bed numbers may vary from country to country , the minimum standards for accommodation can be more assertively presented . All accommodation should be fit for its purpose and , whilst possibly provided in older settings , must aspire to contemporary values of dignity and respect for residents . It is essential for the purposes of recovery that the environment is appropriate . Environmental risks must be assessed and addressed in regard to the particular needs of the residents .
2 . Contracts may contain a clause providing for the price referred to in the fourth indent of paragraph 1 to be revised once or several times before delivery of the product , but no later than 30 November . This revision should be based on objective elements such as the world price trend and the quantity and quality of the product obtained ; in the event of disagreement , the original contract price shall remain valid .
Whereas , in view of the situation in the Netherlands , where insurance brokers are , depending on their professional knowledge , divided up into several categories , an equivalent system should be provided for in respect of nationals of other Member States who wish to take up an activity in one or other of the categories concerned ; whereas the most appropriate and objective criterion for this purpose is the number of employees whom the person concerned has or has had working under him ;
( 2 ) It is appropriate to extend the cooperation of the Contracting Parties to the Agreement to include Decision No 845 / 2004 / EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 amending Decision No 163 / 2001 / EC on the implementation of a training programme for professionals in the European audiovisual programme industry ( MEDIA-Training ) ( 2001-2005 ) &amp; # 91 ; 2 &amp; # 93 ; , as corrected by OJ L 195 , 2.6.2004 , p . 1 .

If within that period , the Council has indicated by qualified majority that it opposes the proposal , the Commission shall re-examine it . It may submit an amended proposal to the Council , resubmit its proposal or present a legislative proposal . If on the expiry of that period the Council has neither adopted the proposed implementing act nor indicated its opposition to the proposal for implementing measures , the proposed implementing act shall be adopted by the Commission .
( 72 ) The Community industry submitted that a profit margin of 13 % on turnover would be more appropriate than the 6 % profit margin that was used for the provisional injury margin calculation . It argued that a company &amp; apos ; s own capital resources should at least earn a return on net assets which equals bank loan rates . It was further claimed that this level of profit was reached in 1996 , when conditions of fair competition prevailed .
( 3 ) The Brussels European Council of 17 and 18 June 2004 adopted the European Security Strategy : Comprehensive Policy towards Bosnia and Herzegovina .

( 6 ) In the updated programme the debt ratio is estimated to have reached 45.9 % of GDP in 2004 , against 49 % forecast in the May 2004 Convergence Programme and below the 60 % of GDP Treaty reference value . The programme projects the debt ratio to increase by a cumulative 1.8 percentage points over the period 2004-2007 , with the increase coming to a halt only in the last year of the programme .
2 . By way of derogation from paragraph 1 , the competent authorities may permit those institutions which are obliged to meet the capital requirements calculated in accordance with Articles 21 and 28 to 32 and Annexes I and III to VI to use , for that purpose only , an alternative determination of own funds .

Any additional guarantees may be determined under the procedure laid down in Article 26 . 4 . Before 31 December 1997 the Commission shall submit a report together with any appropriate proposals on the implementation of this Article in the light in particular of scientific and technological developments .
At this stage , taking account of the information at its disposal , the Commission doubts that the aid is compatible with the common market since the method of calculating the loss threshold triggering eligibility for aid and the method of calculating the aid do not correspond to those laid down in the Community guidelines for State aid in the agricultural sector , and the possibility that excessive compensation may have been paid for the losses suffered cannot , therefore , be ruled out .
In addition , the European Space Programme will take account of private sector stakeholders . Programme management will maximise the development of products and services to be supplied by the private sector to governmental and commercial customers . In particular , risk-sharing public private partnerships will be explored wherever possible . All stakeholders will be consulted during the setting up and periodic review of the programme .

Having regard to Council Directive 91 / 496 / EEC of 15 July 1991 laying down the principles governing the organisation of veterinary checks on animals entering the Community and amending Directives 89 / 662 / EEC , 90 / 425 / EEC and 90 / 675 / EEC ( 3 ) , as last amended by Directive 96 / 43 / EC ( 4 ) , and in particular Article 10 thereof ,
( 108 ) This competitor also thinks that the quid pro quo offered is not sufficient to achieve the reduction of capacities in MobilCom &amp; apos ; s core business necessary for offsetting distortions of competition . MobilCom wanted to concentrate on high ‐ yield customers in the middle and upper segments . Consequently , despite a decline in customers , it would be able to maintain its market presence since , by concentrating on high ‐ yield customers , costs could be reduced and turnovers increased .
( 7 ) In addition , by Council Decision 2004 / 650 / EC of 13 September 2004 amending Regulation ( EC ) No 998 / 2003 &amp; # 91 ; 2 &amp; # 93 ; , Malta was added to the list of countries in part A of Annex II to the Regulation . Consequently specific provisions applying to entries of pet animals into Ireland , Sweden and the United Kingdom should be extended to Malta .
1 . On 22 March 2004 the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations with certain other Members of the WTO under Article XXIV.6 of the GATT 1994 , in the course of the accessions to the European Community of Czech Republic , the Republic of Estonia , the Republic of Cyprus , the Republic of Latvia , the Republic of Lithuania , the Republic of Hungary , the Republic of Malta , the Republic of Poland , the Republic of Slovenia and the Slovak Republic .
Whereas the Decision of 21 April 1970 on the replacement of financial contributions from Member States by the Communities &amp; apos ; own resources ( 4 ) provides that the budget of the Communities shall , irrespective of other revenue , be financed entirely from the Communities &amp; apos ; own resources ; whereas these resources are to include those accruing from value added tax and obtained by applying a common rate of tax on a basis of assessment determined in a uniform manner according to Community rules ;
( 2 ) Pursuant to Article 5 of Commission Regulation ( EC ) No 580 / 2004 of 26 March 2004 establishing a tender procedure concerning export refunds for certain milk products &amp; # 91 ; 3 &amp; # 93 ; and following an examination of the tenders submitted in response to the invitation to tender , it is appropriate to fix a maximum export refund for the tendering period ending on 25 April 2006 .
( 61 ) The significant increase in free market consumption during 2000 and 2001 is partly explained by higher economic activity in the Community as well as on the world market , and partly by the enforcement of a new export licensing system in the PRC . The latter prompted massive purchases ( stock-building by users ) towards the end of 2000 and during 2001 for fear of eventual shortages of raw materials and the product concerned .
Whereas Regulation ( EEC ) No 357 / 79 provides that the Member States concerned are to carry out basic surveys of areas under vines every 10 years ; whereas , for technical and practical reasons , certain Member States , however , consider that it would be appropriate to link up this operation with the Community survey on the structure of agriculture holdings provided for by Council Regulation ( EEC ) No 571 / 88 ( 4 ) ;
3.1 In order to promote a sustainable transport system and secure a balance between transport modes , as set out in the White Paper on European Transport Policy for 2010 , the Community has set itself an objective of increasing the share of freight transport by rail . Improving the quality of service in rail freight transport is one of many approaches to achieving that objective and is in principle to be welcomed .
( 46 ) In order to ensure uniform application of the principle of good faith throughout the Community , where amounts unduly paid are recovered , the conditions under which that principle may be invoked should be laid down without prejudice to the treatment of the expenditure concerned in the context of the clearance of accounts under Council Regulation ( EC ) No 1258 / 1999 of 17 May 1999 on the financing of the common agricultural policy ( 12 ) .
3 .

1 . Notified operators shall publish from 31 December 2000 , and keep updated , a reference offer for unbundled access to their local loops and related facilities , which shall include at least the items listed in the Annex . The offer shall be sufficiently unbundled so that the beneficiary does not have to pay for network elements or facilities which are not necessary for the supply of its services , and shall contain a description of the components of the offer , associated terms and conditions , including charges .
4 . The Member States shall send the Commission full information and any subsequent changes in their regulation concerning the methods used to calculate the risk exposures mentioned in paragraph 3 , including the risk exposure to a counterparty in OTC derivative transactions , no later than 13 February 2004 . The Commission shall forward that information to the other Member States . Such information will be the subject of exchanges of views within the Contact Committee in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 53 ( 4 ) . % quot % ;

Having regard to Council Regulation ( EEC ) No 426 / 86 of 24 February 1986 on the common organization of the market in products processed from fruit and vegetables ( 1 ) , as last amended by Commission Regulation ( EC ) No 2314 / 95 ( 2 ) , and in particular Article 13 ( 8 ) thereof ,
The beneficiaries of this scheme are all in Umbria , which is not an Art. 87.3 ( a ) area in the current regional aid map . Therefore the aid could not be justified under the regional aid guidelines . Since Italy has failed to identify any other justification for this plant to benefit from aid , the Commission has doubts that the aid could be compatible .
( 13 ) Whereas Article 5 of First Council Directive 89 / 104 / EEC of 21 December 1988 to approximate the laws of the Member States relating to trade marks ( 8 ) confers exclusive rights on the proprietor of a registered trade mark , including the right to prevent all third parties from using , in the course of trade , any sign which is identical with , or similar to , the trade mark in relation to identical goods or services or even , where appropriate , other goods ;
